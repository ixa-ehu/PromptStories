I am driving with Sarah, when all of the sudden a truck slams into us. The next thing I knew was that I am in a hospital bed—on a ventilator and unable to move. <newline> Sarah is in the room with me. All these years we have been together, she always seemed to know what to say and when to say it. This seemed like one of those times, so I closed my eyes and waited to hear what she would say. <newline> “...” <newline> “I’m sorry Robert.” <newline> My eyes burst open, and I can see Sarah with tears in her eyes. <newline> “I’m so, so sorry.” <newline> Sorry? What was there to be sorry for? The collision? There was nothing we could’ve done to stop that truck from crashing into us. I ask Sarah if that is what this is about. <newline> “…I couldn’t stop it.” <newline> Sarah starts to sob again. This was a habit of hers, to always blame herself whenever something bad happens. I’ve always told her that she needs to stop putting so much pressure on herself, so again, I tell her that it wasn’t her fault. <newline> “You don’t understand! And whenever I tell you, you never believe me!” <newline> Don’t understand? Never believe? What is Sarah going on about? I decide to ask her. <newline> Sarah is silent, so I ask her again. <newline> “I can rewind time. I can only go back a few minutes, but it’s still time travel. You never believe me whenever I tell you.” <newline> I don’t say anything. <newline> “But that’s not important now. I just want to take this time and tell you I’m sorry.” <newline> Again with the apologizing! She’s asking me to believe in magic and here I am asking HER to believe that she is not responsible for what happened. <newline> “It’s as if the universe wants you dead, and I can’t stop it! I’ve travelled back so many times to save you, to prevent you from ending up hospitalized. But every damn time I save you from something, another thing comes and takes it’s place!” <newline> “First, we would skid off road and into a pole. I went back and warned you to drive more carefully, and when you did, some car would T-bone us. Again, I travelled back and told you to pull over for a few minutes. But when we did that, someone came and mugged us. I kept trying over, and over again to save you, and I’ve always failed. So…I eventually gave up and let you become hospitalized.” <newline> I sat there, dumbfounded at what Sarah was saying. <newline> “And that’s why I’m sorry. I gave up trying to save you. And since we are now in the hospital, I can’t even rewind far back enough to try again. After trying countless times to save you, I can’t help but feel like if I just tried *one more time*…then things would’ve ended up differently.” <newline> Sarah stopped talking and started sobbing again. As she sat there weeping, I kept thinking about what to say. I don’t believe any of this time travel stuff, but Sarah isn’t the lying type. Even if what she was saying is untrue, she definitely feels genuine guilt over what happened. <newline> I decided to act as if I really believed she could time travel, if only to ease her guilt. I then told Sarah that I forgive her for not trying one more time, that all the times she tried to save me is all I would ever ask of her. <newline> “Thank you, Robert.” <newline> Sarah s
"Today, my apprentice", said Hermes Trismegistus, "you shall learn the secret of the Elixir of Life." <newline> Erin was excited. Finding the mysterious immortal master of alchemy and magic was a goal of a lifetime. Convincing him to teach her was another. Now, the old mystic finally trusted her enough that he decided to share his great secret. <newline> "Here are the ingredients", Hermes said. <newline> "Let me see", Erin mumbled when she took the list. "Eye of newt, toe of frog... wait, what is this? Metamizole, aspirin, drotaverine and alprazolam? What are modern drugs doing in this list?" <newline> "This, daughter, is the Azoth of Life", Hermes answered. "The principal ingredient of the elixir. In my time, the Azoth was thought to be a mysterious substance. I found it by chance. My stash of it was already running low when I found out that mortal chemists discovered Azoth on their own and are now mass-producing it." <newline> "But which drug exactly is Azoth?" <newline> "That's where the hurdle lies. I forgot which of these four is Azoth", the venerable wizard said. "So I include all four in the mixture, just to be sure". <newline> "Could you find it by experiment, master?" <newline> "What kind of experiment? Excluding the drugs from the recipe of the elixir one by one and seeing which one will make me keel over and die?" <newline> "I could test it", Erin volunteered. "I shall prepare the elixir with one drug, then with another, and see which one will work. How do I tell that the elixir of life worked?" <newline> "It wil cure your gastritis", Trismegistus explained.

Terrance blinked. <newline> Then, he rubbed his eyes and blinked again. The strange, tentacled being continued to float in front of him. <newline> “So… you’re here about… the roommate application?” He asked slowly. <newline> A single tentacle waved a newspaper clipping in his face. <newline> “I… see,” he said. “You’re a bit noticeable. How did you even get here?” <newline> The being shimmered for a moment and they were suddenly replaced with a brunette in a business suit. She crossed her arms and raised one manicured eyebrow. Only her multicolored eyes pointed to her being something completely different. <newline> “Oh, illusions,” Terrance said. “Neat.” <newline> They shimmered and the floating creature reappeared. Their tentacles continued to undulate as if they were swimming through the air. <newline> “Uh… this is all a bit sudden. I wasn’t really expecting anyone for a few days at least,” he continued. “Why did you choose this place?” <newline> The being’s many eyes narrowed. The air around him seemed to tremble. Terrance felt a small seed of unease form in the pit of his stomach. Then, the pressure dissipated. The being seemed to sag in the air as if it had expended a great deal of energy. There was a strangled scream of fear and ecstasy from next door. Terrance frowned. <newline> “Did… did you do that?” He asked. <newline> The being nodded, their body bobbing as they did. <newline> “Oh. What, am I immune or something?” <newline> Another nod. <newline> “Huh. That’s a thing.” <newline> Their tentacles wiggled in agreement. With a mental shrug, Terrance continued the interview. <newline> “Well, come in. I can show you the place at least. Sorry it’s a bit cluttered. If you give me a moment, I can shift some stuff so you can move around.” <newline> The being waved their tentacles as if refusing. Then, they shrank slightly and floated past the doorway. <newline> “That’s handy,” Terrance said. <newline> He showed them the different rooms in his apartment. <newline> “My previous roommate was really messy. It took me days to clean up his room after he bailed on the rent. The stuff he left behind wasn’t even worth that much. Honestly, if you can help keep the place clean, you’d already be a better roommate than him.” <newline> The being rotated, taking in the empty room. Their tentacles waved for a moment and a ball of dust formed before them. That clump floated over to the trashcan in the bathroom. <newline> “Wow,” Terrance said with a laugh. “That’s amazing.” <newline> Then, he coughed, trying to regain a formal tone. <newline> “If you don’t mind me asking, do you work anywhere? What’s your normal schedule like?” <newline> His vision swam and the room blurred for a moment. An image of that brunette working in a hospital setting floated through his mind. He blinked and he was back in his apartment. The being stared at him expectantly. <newline> “Health care worker, huh? That’s impressive,” he said. “Do your abilities come in handy there?” <newline> A nod. <newline> “Do you have any special needs or requests for moving in?” <newline> They shook their head, or body, depending on the perspective. A minimalistic room floated through his mind. A few plants sat on a table under the window. <newline> “Oh, you like gardening?” <newline> They wiggled their tentacles as if to say it was a hobby. <newline> “Anything else I should know about?” He asked. “Any convictions? Regular visitors?” <newline> They shook their head again. This time, there was an odd sense of sadness about the being. Terrance frowned but nodded anyway. <newline> “Do you have a name?” <newline> A deep, oddly feminine voice echoed through his mind. <newline> “Xaiores.” <newline> There was a slight pressure on his mind as they spoke. But it was nothing compared to what they had demonstrated earlier. Terrance reached out a hand a shook a tentacle. <newline> “Nice to meet you. I hope we get along.” <newline> ... <newline> Short and sweet. <newline> If you're interested in my works, an archive of my various writing responses can be found [here](https://cuckoosneststories.wordpress.com/). <newline> Thanks for reading.
Witches were a scourge to the land. Captured, burnt, if they weren't killed first. Though it wasn't always witches he was after- the church also had some other pests. <newline> Such as a thief that managed to pilfer a considerable sum of gold from the treasury after picking the lock. Seems that he had done his homework, and knew the timing of the guards- hespent time going in and out as they came and went. <newline> The knight of a man in the following days tracked the thief, well practiced in such things from years of chasing after witches that dared step foot in towns. The thief was cornered, and of course ran when he realized the trap. <newline> The knight however failed to take notice that his target was not alone. When he crossed from road into wooded land, undergrowth reaching to the light, a hail of arrows came for him as if materialized from the thickets. Most struck his armor, bouncing away harmlessly. <newline> One, however, found its mark. It struck squarely in the seam of his metal, punched through leather, and further into his chest. The force that arrow had was stunning, then the searing pain as the metal head has slipped around bone and threatened his heart. The knight stumbled, twisted, and fell to his back as he listened to his ears ring thanks to grit teeth and the fading footsteps of the thieves. <newline> He wasn't sure how long he laid among the ferns. His body didn't allow him to move. Later, he heard the galloping steps again. Wondering if the thieves were returning to finish the job, he closed his eyes again. At least until he paid attention to the steps as they closed in- it was a gallop, but it thundered against the earth well before it was even close. <newline> Next he opened his eyes, a truly gigantic horse was staring down at him. Blue eyes met his, and the nose of the beast edged close to where the arrow pierced- <newline> "Bo," his thought was interrupted by a voice, "go make sure nobody else is here." The knight had been drained of his energy. Sapped away shamefully by a single arrow. He couldn't even turn his head to the voice, just stared skyward as the horse trotted off. <newline> A face moved over his. His eyes focused to see fair skin mottled as if sunlight filtered by leaves was on the woman's face. Touched by some scarring on one jaw, he couldn't help but notice. Yet what drew his sight was the woman's eyes- they had no iris or even pupil for what he could tell. It was like two orbs of opal were looking at the arrow while one hand barely touched it to know how deep it reached. She was a witch, had to be. Golden-red hair, strange eyes. Not to mention that this woman was a giantess, much like that horse. <newline> He heard a whinny in the distance. Her head turned, and he saw long ears as she created a shrill whistle. Probably to call the horse back. <newline> He dreaded her turning back. His mind raced in thought as what a witch would do to him- between vengeance and using him for testing potions. <newline> His mind slowed as he realized she was speaking some tongue. Exhaustion set over him heavily like a blanket. He fought hard to resist his eyes closing, and did. He saw a hand wrap around the arrow just as he slipped away from the waking world. <newline> His return was a crackling hearth. Then warm wooden walls. Furs hanging on one of them. His head rolled, and realized he smelled food. He also spotted the tools of alchemy. Somehow, now, he didn't have the heart to take up his weapon. Instead his head rolled to the other side- a cup and some bread set on a tray. He was alone. He looked down to see the arrow was gone, with but a bandage crossing his bare chest under the blanket. <newline> There was some commotion outside. The witch's voice and the horse, it seemed. The door opened to the woman carrying cut meat, and the horse insisting on sticking its head through the door to look at him. <newline> The meat was set down in the kitchen, then she took notice of her horse. Following it's sight. <newline> "Oh! You're awake," she spoke common tongue again. "Thank the Gods I was hunting nearby." He recognized the voice. She came close again and he inspectedthe scar again. It were as if by boiling water or acid- skin pulled tight and from her jaw down to her neck. He knew her- and knew her well. The fine furs, the crafts, the wine... <newline> The trader woman, Indara. What she truly was, was a witch. A giant of one. And he has spoken so much if his hunts to her. <newline> She too was a witch. Yet he couldn't find the will to even think badly of her.
Their initial bombardment was effective, right out of the scorched earth playbook. What happened next was possibly the dumbest move the aliens could have made. They landed. They landed all their ships, all two hundred in the middle of the now desolate terrain they made with their first attack. Together they formed a series of concentric circles resembling a labyrinth with each ship a fortress unto itself. <newline> They had given up the high ground. From space they could have bombed us into oblivion. Their initial salvo was proof that they knew of the concept of orbital bombardment. The very idea of landing set every earth military analyst into fits, with how stupid they were. We, Earth, waited for what came next but to our surprise the aliens didn’t send out air patrols, their communications were transmitted unencrypted. Their ground patrols had vehicles but may as well been summarized as two by orange pickups with overly large crossbows on the back. <newline> We began moving our spy planes closer to the landing site, again we were met with surprise. No missiles shot them down, no lasers attempted to blind our sensors, and no jamming was detected. We were able to maintain persistent surveillance over our enemy and they did nothing to stop us. The UN Security council approved unanimously to begin the counter attack. Our missiles weren’t intercepted, our tanks smashed their lines, armies from across the world had the enemy surrounded and was met by an army closer to the roman legion than a modern military. They outnumbered us, but not our bullets. <newline> Two years of researching their now captured tech showed brilliant engine designs. Their military tech and tactics however never seemed to evolve past the early Iron Age. A mystery that we planned to unravel as we sped toward them in our new war ships. We however weren’t going to give up the high ground.
“I can cast a few spells,” Dorrine said, nodding her head gently. <newline> The man at the desk looked at her over the top of his thin glasses. They didn’t fit his face, she thought. They were too old fashioned, too thin, too… much. His face was stern but she was having trouble taking him seriously. <newline> “And those would be?” the man asked. <newline> Dorrine looked down at his desk where the small placard sat. “Headmaster Timothy Ward.” <newline> “Well, Mister Ward,” she began — trying her hardest to ooze respect, “I can cast a warming spell over as many as 3 people. I can enchant a mug to keep its contents hot for several days at a time. I can create a spark to light a fire from nothing. I can -” <newline> “I see,” he interrupted. “So you have chosen to focus on heat-related spells then. What do you think you will bring to this institution?” <newline> “Oh, I’m sorry.” She fidgeted in her seat, trying to keep her hips comfortable and her anxiety low. “I don’t want you to get the impression I *ignored* other types of magic. Those are just the ones I’ve gotten to work so far. They are all perfect, zero issues, I just don’t seem to do as well with other types…” <newline> As she trailed off she watched his face. His lips pursed together, but otherwise, he sat silent and motionless. <newline> Clearing her throat, Dorrine shifted once more and straightened her shoulders. “I would bring discipline, tenacity, and a view of the world that most students here don’t have. I’m not sliced bread here, obviously, but I think I belong and would do well.” <newline> The headmaster gave a small nod and pulled his eyes downward. His hands shifted through the small stack of paperwork on his desk. Her application, her history, a few exams and essays she had taken already. It all seemed extremely formal to her. <newline> “Your mana.” He didn’t look up as he spoke again. “Are these readings accurate?” <newline> She cleared her throat again. “Yes, sir. I seldom run out. I can cast for quite a long time in a stretch.” <newline> He still didn’t look up but sorted the papers a few more times before stacking them together and shoving them to the side. “Okay. You will hear from us. You are welcome to stay in the guest dorms until we make our decision.” <newline> Her mouth opened to say something. She hadn’t expected to be told to sit around and wait for them to give her an answer. It sounded prideful even in her head, but she thought hey would welcome her with open arms. Instead of make a fool of herself, however, she closed her mouth again and smiled. Her hand extended out to shake his, but he gave an imperceptible shake, and her arm dropped back to her side. <newline> Narrowly missing his desk on the way down. <newline> A small thing to be thankful for she figured as she stood up. “Thank you for your time.” No other words were spoken as she turned and walked out the door. <newline> *Asshole,* she thought as it shut behind her. <newline> Dorrine walked through the exit of the administration building and made her way across the campus. A few of the students shot her looks as she walked, a few raised their eyebrows, and a group of three tiny women pointed and whispers as she made her way past them. She thought it would be more if she was going, to tell the truth. Her reputation wasn’t exactly *nothing.* <newline> Even if the headmaster had managed to make her feel that way. But she knew it didn’t matter, she didn’t come to the school to be popular. She came to learn, expand, get stronger. <newline> Anyone who made her life harder would just have to watch their backs once she succeeded. <newline>
It is the famous liquor shop in the whole world. An entryway for people to a new start - a literal way to get a new life and persona. What’s the catch, you ask? You don’t get to choose. You get lucky or you don’t. Sounds simple but the advise is to only come here when you are 100% sure with no regrets to leave this life you currently have. <newline> “Are you ready?” The bartender with a name tag Gee asked me as she places the cocktail in front of me. This is for me, a drink that is fated for me, made at the specific time I chose to enter the shop. <newline> I nod my head and gave an assuring smile. <newline> This is it! A goodbye and hello. I down the cocktail in one long gulp like its water. Then, everything seemed to happen fast from hearing a glass break, people murmuring, and vehicles honking. I can only hear even as I kept my eyes open. All I see is black during the warp and just how it started so suddenly it also stopped that way. Eerily peaceful, I noticed I am now in closed eyes and on a comfortable bed. <newline> I open my eyes and the restart, the place I was destined to, was not anything I have expected. <newline> Why here?
I'm the Pig Princess. <newline> I know what you say about me behind closed doors. Call me what you want, I don't care. I've heard it all. <newline> Pig Princess. Hog Whore. Lady Bacon. I don't care. Words can't hurt me. <newline> They say a princess' spirit animal reflects their nature. I know. I'm fat. I'm ugly. I'm nasty. I'm horrible. Is that what you want me to say? Is that what you want to hear? <newline> Boris is my only true friend. He can't speak, but he can grunt. He's clever, much cleverer that most of these pitchfork-toting peasants. He's strong, he's sneaky, he's ruthless. <newline> We do lots of things together, Boris and I. We eat together, hunt together. Boris loves chasing rabbits. It's a challenge, since they run so fast. They're always surprised when Boris is faster. Did you know that rabbits can scream? Maybe one day I'll let Boris show you. <newline> I'd protect Boris with my life, just like he would protect my life with his. Remember that advisor, the one with far too many gold rings and far too little sense? The one that whispered to my father, the king, trying to suggest to get Boris slaughtered? <newline> He mysteriously disappeared, never to be seen again. Sometimes I still find gold rings in Boris' pen. <newline> My father knows my value. I'm smart. I'm clever. I write laws. I pass judgement. I do trade. I make money. I have built the kingdom, just as much as my father did. And yet my family still sneers at me, just because I'm the Pig Princess. <newline> Well, jokes on you, *sisters*. All you pretty princesses are livestock, groomed and fed for market day where they auction you off to the highest bidder, for some other prince to bed, to become second fiddle to some other throne, sat on by some other royal, in some other kingdom in who-cares-where. <newline> Not me. I know which throne I'm after. <newline> You can't get rid of me, Father. No matter how hard you try. No one will marry me. Even if they did, I turn them down. Your assassins can't kill me. Boris can smell their bloodthirst, and the blood comes right after. You'll never get rid of me, and when the time is right, you'll never see me coming either. <newline> I'm the Pig Princess. Hog Whore. Lady Bacon. Curse me all you want, call me what you like. Call those names while you still can. <newline> One day, you will call me Queen, nothing else, *and there's nothing you can do about it.*
"Human pistol, specifically a Model of 1911, mainly produced from their early twentieth century to the late twenty-first, however production continues in small scale due to nostalgia surrounding the design. Now, why did you have me come out to the ass end of the galaxy to look at this thing when you could've sent it to my office?" <newline> "Welker, I'd have thought someone in such a new field would be keen to promote it, but regardless you're the only Human Cultural Expert in the system. Now, are you certain about that 200 year time frame?" <newline> "Yes, it's in the name, 1911. Why?" <newline> "It was found in a 8.76 billion year old sealed sarcophagi along with human remains along with writing in human script." <newline> "Well? What did the script say?" <newline> "Here have a look."
"*... it's been, what, three months now?*" <newline> *Ẓ̷̢̌̕ȧ̸͖̈g̷̞͎͂r̵̜̒̋ù̴͙̔ṣ̴͌̽* again had that expression about him. If you were careful, you could see the many eyes across his being, popping in and out of perceptibility, each raise its respective brow incredulously. He let the squeak of the metal swing sound once more. <newline> "*I'm flattered you remember how long it's been.*" And impressed she could still keep time in his presence. <newline> "*How could I forget? It was the most quiet my neighbors had been in ages.*" Meg let crack a sly yet genuinely happy smile. <newline> "̸͓̮͚̽͌͋*And you nearly bled out like they did, too.*"̷̢̗̭͝ Little scaled &amp; furry finger tips appeared to prod Meg teasingly in most of her tickly spots. Tensing instinctively, she realized not a one poked her where she wasn't okay with, and enjoyed a giggle. <newline> "*Hey, there was still a cat with a sprained tail on my porch. Only made sense to bring you a bowl of milk... even with napkins shoved up my face.*" <newline> "̷̢̗̭͝*You know that... wasn't milk you gave me.*"̸͓̮͚̽͌͋ <newline> "*No, it was definitely milk. It tasted like milk, right?*" <newline> "̷̞͆..."̷̞͆ Definitely didn't taste like what it was. Zaggy knew it *tasted* like milk only because Meg willed it so. Breathing the very essence of life and sentience, he usually tasted things like abject horror, bone ripped through pulsing flesh, and pineapple on pizza. All perfectly natural parts of a growing horror's diet, mind. But it was the first time someone willed something *for* him, instead of *at*. First time someone could see he was injured and needed help, too. <newline> Turns out, though, he didn't like milk. <newline> Meg looked at one of his tails, and watched it flick and sway from side to side with ease. She could even make out the rhythm of his breath, slower now than that first night, feeling the occasional breeze before he inhaled the life of it, too. <newline> "*Does this mean you need to go now?*" Another push of the swing, and off he went through the still air. <newline> "̷͖̘̀̎͜*... you would have me stay? I do not believe your family could take much more of my being.*"̴͚̿ <newline> Tears welled up and dripped down her cheeks, without a hint of change in her dry demeanor and high pitched tone. "*Yeah. It's nice and quiet with you around, and my nose bleeds have even stopped!*" <newline> He only ventured to find out where those tears came from once, having sniffed at her cheek, and all he got was a faces full of lilac. They then spent the weekend mopping up *his* nosebleed, all the while Meg laughed at the irony, and rushing to make sure every trace of Lilac in the house was thrown out. Whatever place those tears came from, felt more hollow and dark than the wake the oldest of his kind would leave behind. <newline> Still, that 'quiet' was important to her, and he appreciated the subsequent snacks... odd as the tastes she came up with were. <newline> "*Besides, who else is gonna finish The Good Place with me?*" She geared up, and gave one big push. Tendrils grasped at the chains as Zaggy's eyes widened from the sudden rush. <newline> He jumped at the apex, floated down, and landed with an unceremonious, screeching thump. That undulating and swaying facade refracted the breeze and thoughts his breath drew in along the way. Meg could see the eyes and scales and screams and teeth galore, if she focused. It was beautiful for her, and made her wonder if this is what optical illusions were like, changing as she moved her eyes across, yet still when she was. <newline> "̵̖̃*Okay, but how about popcorn this time? I don't think I've tried that yet.*"̵̖̃
What could I do? I got on. <newline> He was tall and slight, all hard angles and straight edges, but as I approached he seemed to grow taller. As I reached my arms up to wrap around his neck, I wasn't quite sure if he was six foot, or ten. He- Michael, I knew his name was Michael, though I knew not how- stooped, hands resting on his knees. <newline> "Up you get," he said, smiling a brilliant smile. <newline> If anyone on the street thought this was strange, they didn't let it show. People moved past, eyes locked to their phone screens as I glanced around myself. <newline> I paused, arms ready to wrap around his neck. <newline> He afforded me a glance, his smile never faded, but a crease began to form on his magnificent eyebrows. "Have you gone deaf?" he questioned, and his voice darkened, "UP." <newline> Any doubt fled me, and my mind was a whirl with the expectation, his neck was thick, and I gripped his shoulders, pulling myself tight. Despite the November chill and the thin, brilliant ivory shirt he wore, Michael was warm to the touch. <newline> Something was wrong. I tried to flinch away, but a haze had filled my head, all I could hear was his voice echoing through my head. <newline> "No," I whispered, even as my own body betrayed me, tightening its grip on the man. <newline> Michael stood tall, and I was a child. My feet dangled below me as I clung desperately to him. This wasn't right, I wasn't... *his.* <newline> "Y-y-you're not him..." I managed to stammer out, my face filled with the coarse shirt, my nose filled with the smell of him. Warm and damp and reeking of rot and sulphur. <newline> Michael shrugged, his smile growing as he cracked his neck, shaking his arms loose. "Is a sheep not a sheep, when it's covered in wool?" As his smile grew, his teeth seemed to elongate, "even when the wolf gets his hands on a new *skin."* <newline> I wanted to scream, I wanted to shout, to claw and run, to gag and wretch. I wanted to wail for a loss that I couldn't comprehend. Instead, I whimpered. <newline> "Good," Michael said. <newline> They say the last dragon was killed by Michael, high upon a hill, before history or war, there was a war to end all history. And as the last dragon fell, so did a shining star... <newline> I was clutching that star, as the heat within him grew, and we took flight. <newline> What could I do? I clutched tighter, and prayed...
Sighs and looks bored. "You had me fill out a three hundred question questionnaire. Take a full day physical. Then left me sitting in a grey room that is a two meter by two meter by two meter cube. . For seven hours. Alone. To ask me *that*?" <newline> "That is the question so are you done wasting time." <newline> "If that is what rocks your boat. Personally you just made watching ants eat a hershey bar seem like fun. It was fun for a few hours. Then the damn paramedics stepped on the bar to check me out. Apparently laying on your stomach in the park is a major health crisis." <newline> "You just watched ants eating chocolate and consider me boring?" <newline> "I said a hershey bar not chocolate. Besides ants don't eat that stuff. Not directly. They take it back into the nest and process it again. Watch them scout it all then line up with a little military precision. Take a bitty piece and scuttle back to the pile. I was identifying the individuals and timing how long it took for them to get back in line." <newline> "Yawn. I asked for a reason not to destroy your world. Can you give me one?" <newline> "Yeah. What's the point? I mean you got the compressed hydrogen release explosion from the core to detonate the planet. You got the drop a good black hole into the planet for an implosion. Simply remove the core and watch the magnetosphere collapse and everything bakes. But you have probably done that a few hundred times each right?" <newline> "More like a few thousand." <newline> "First couple felt satisfying. But it grew old. You didn't wipe out those first few worlds just for the kick of it. Or you wouldn't be looking for an excuse to stop. They did something that offended you at the time. So it felt cathartic ending it all. Then you started doing it to feel some of that rich excitement. But it is fading in allure." <newline> "You act like you know me like you have experienced this." <newline> "Sure. Hollywood and writers do it all the time. Its spectacle creep. See back in the day you had a bad guy. He would be powerful and hard to battle. Hero has to work their way through minions and setbacks. Just to face the bad guy. Now I think the japanese markets get it better. Sword fights. The battle blade to blade is epic. But westerns it was a bullet. The finish of the bad guy. Then they needed to stop the bad guy train or the bad guy had a mansion. So you derail the train or burn down the bad guy house. Then burn turns to blow up. Then you blow up more and more. Then you get to hero blows up a super dangerous moon weapon. They feel good because that is the Climax." <newline> "How does that pertain." <newline> "I'm getting there. For an immortal you lack patience. Spectacle creep means the guys counting money see that explosion as the ring of a register. So the next movie as more and huger splosions! Soon you have Lens Flare Explosion Massacre the Movie. Not even a dumb action flick. And you look for a different smaller story. Because there is a reason over the top is bad. You have to work subtle. Because you can't knock it out of the park if you blow up the park."
"You call this a schematic?" Chief Engineer Schumer for the United World Government asked the man in the red robes, "It's just a pentagram with different colored candles at the points and gibberish written in the center." <newline> "It's a HEXagram," the man bristled, rubbing his unkempt beard, "Don't even know the difference between penta and hexa. You call yourself a scientist?" <newline> "Do YOU call yourself a scientist?" the engineer bristled, "This is mumbo jumbo..." <newline> "I call myself an OCCULT scientist, Mr. Schumer," the wizard stepped next to him, "Don't forget the recitation and the proper sacrifice. Interstellar travel can be very dangerous if you don't appease the demon of the gateways. A chicken will do for a short jump but I'd up it to a goat or even an oxen for longer ones, to be safe you know." <newline> "And this works?" Schumer turned to President Dixon skeptically. <newline> "Of course," the President said with a suave southern accent and charisma honed by three decades in politics, "Do ya think I'd risk my position on this hogwash otherwise? I've seen Proxima Centauri with my own eyes. I've stepped foot on New Terra although it needs some work before we can get people to live there. Nasty group of native elves don't like us a visitin', can you believe that?" <newline> "My God," Schumer, the avowed atheist said now rethinking his religious stance, "This is crazy." <newline> "The IMM has been working behind the scenes since World War II, Mr. Schumer," the wizard told him, eyes sparkling, "Ever since we developed the atomic bomb the..." <newline> "Wait, are you kidding me?" Schumer rubbed his temple. <newline> "Of course not," the wizard was starting to look bored, "Surely you don't believe all that mumbo jumbo about splitting atoms? No, you see we simply trap a sun demon inside of a small jar. When the jar hits above the target then BLAM! No more Hiroshima. By the way, we took out Hiroshima because that's where the main enclave of Japanese mages was centered." <newline> "And now you've discovered faster than light travel?" the engineer asked, needing a stiff drink. <newline> "Well, harnessing the Interstellar Aether is a problem we've been working on since medevil times. We should have enough mages trained to man colony ships by this time next year, to do the "mumbo jumbo" as you put it." the elderly mage finished. <newline> "What about engineers?" Schumer asked. <newline> "Well," the wizard grinned, "We do need someone to keep the toilets working."
The day was a good day when I left home to go to work. I had a nice conversation with my mother about what we were going to do for the holiday. It was also the day that bonuses were going to be given out and I was positive I'd be given a good one. <newline> Upon reaching my job and went through the checks. I was immediately called to my boss's office. Wondering why I was being called, I began to walk there. However on the way, I saw that the kitchen was a mess. Deciding that my boss could wait, I realized that a hour had passed and felt slightly worried but also pleased that the kitchen was clean. <newline> Wiping my hands, I began walking to my boss's office. Upon reaching it, I looked through the window and saw that boss was not happy at all. Knocking on his door, I was called to enter. Once inside and closing the door, I saw that my boss's desk was a mess with paper everywhere and there was a pen lying on the ground. <newline> Being unable to focus on what my boss was saying while resisting the temptation to fix the mess. My focus was broken when my boss screamed. <newline> "Are you fucking listening to me, boy? You are fired!" <newline> "What do you mean...why?" I replied confused. <newline> "You have been an disputant and causing issues around the workplace. Now leave or I'll get security!" <newline> Deciding I could not fight boss about being fired, I began to leave the room and took my things. <newline> Once arriving home, I began to neatly organize my things before trying to work out what I was going to do now. Deciding to update my resume to find a job, I began working on it. That was when an idea came to me. 'Why don't I just rob houses until I get a job, I'm sure that I would not get caught. After being confidence that this would work and now how to enter them. <newline> Heading out to the shops, I brought a bottle of coke, a lock picking kit ad a map of the local area. Being satisfied, I began walking to the house further down the road where an old lady lived. Upon reaching the location, it was already quiet dark and no one was around. Getting into the backyard, I began to work on the lock. To my surprise, it opened easily. Sneaking inside, to my horror the place was a mess and nothing was in order. Trying not to panic, I decided to begin cleaning the whole place up while avoiding the bathroom where the old woman was sleeping. <newline> When the whole place was clean, I felt amazing and that the day was still a good day. Looking around, I began to look for anything that would sell for a good price. The things I chose to take includes two beautiful jars, a box of jewelry, a bag of chips and some orange juice before leaving. After making sure the door was close, I began walking home. <newline> The next day, I went to a pawn shop ad sold all of the items for a few hundred dollars. Deciding that it was best to pose job applications and get groceries before heading home. While at the store, I saw the old lady talking about how she had been robbed but that the house was so spotless. Feeling pleased with myself with the compliment, I began to have a bounce in my step as I collected what I needed for a few weeks. Upon getting home, I organized my items before waiting for any letters to come. When none came, I decided to apply for some more online before cleaning up and watching tv. <newline> Every few days I would go and rob someone's house after cleaning but found it strange that many valuable items were out in the open or in boxes. I finally decided to watch the news and saw them talking about me. I was surprised that I was being called the "Neat Freak robber" and that a lot was pleased since their houses were spotless. Thinking over this, I decided to just continue robbing and the payment would be cleaning since I might not be getting a job anytime soon.
From the time I was no larger than a grapefruit, I made a covenant with God to grow into the greatest documentary filmmaker the world outside of the womb had ever seen. Don’t ask how I was sentient enough to actually remember this. Some feelings, some memories, are indescribably innate and this is one of them. <newline> Which is why I’m currently knee-deep in sweetgrass with a massive camcorder pressed to my eye. The year is 2008, I’m ready to make my mark, and I’m all but stalking a wild cat. <newline> There is no greater mystery or miracle on this planet than the cat; evolution doesn’t begin to explain the reverence I feel for the sly beast dashing gracefully toward the forest. If there’s anyone who can capture the truth of these creatures, it’s me. My camera rolls. I can’t wait to show my mom. <newline> The cat veers to the right. Unexpected. Interesting. Keeping me on my toes. <newline> But I’m prepared for the unexpected, and so when the cat veers, I don’t lose it. <newline> Gradually, the woodland landscape morphs into something less wild and more… intentional. Paths are pressed beneath my feet, but they’re small–too narrow for human feet. Parts of the forest feel plotted out, as if by a city planner. The cat slows. I hang back. <newline> And then it fucking speaks. <newline> “MOONPAW!” Cat hollers. <newline> My jaw is unhinged. <newline> A teen-cat creeps out of the weeds. “Firestar,” teen-cat–Moonpaw?--says, bashful. “You’re back soon.” <newline> “Yeah,” Cat–Firestar–says, amused now. “Thanks for keeping up with border patrol. I had to cut my hunt short. This dumbass Twoleg is right on my tail and I couldn’t lose it.” <newline> Twoleg? What’s a–- <newline> In unison, the two cats turn to look at me. And I realize. I’m the Twoleg. <newline> “Do you think it understands English?” Moonpaw asks. <newline> Firestar’s tail flicks. He snorts, sighs, turns back to Moonpaw. “Our cover’s blown, kid. Rally the Elders.” <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> (I can't actually remember if there are Elders.)
Hey there its's Josh, welcome back to Let's Game It Out and today we are checking out this new world that the Gods so kindly gave me the key for called Mossar. Thank you Gods I hope you don't regret this choice. <newline> Mossar is a pretty standard isekai fantasy world meaning it has a lot of elements from the Holy Roman Empire but that is not why we are here, we are here for the magic. As far as I can tell, the magic in Mossar works when you speak an incantation or poem or whatever and then the magic happens whether that is a fire ball or an illusion or whatever your little heart may desire. So of course my first course of action was too say the incantation wrong, I'll start with the classic fire ball spell. <newline> *Ignis, Lord of Fire, the one of heat and destruction heed my call... could I have some water?* <newline> Oh! Oh my. Hahaha! Ok so, in case you missed that, instead of the fire ball spell making, you know, a fire ball, Ignis blew me up. He must not have liked that. So that makes me want to ask, what else can I make go wrong. Be right back. <newline> \*Many Hours Later\* <newline> It turns out that all twelve spirits of magic hate me. When you call their name they are obligated to fulfill some type of magic so I have been using the almighty spirits to create a world wide labyrinth using magic that doesn't belong to them. I haven't been counting but I think I managed to capture four different kingdoms in the walls. And you'll never guess who we found ruling one of these kingdoms. That's right, it's Queen Grace! <newline> Moving up in the world, are ya Grace? Perfect. <newline> Some of you may be asking how I got enough magic to pull this off. Simple really! First I call a spirit of magic which only takes a little bit of mana and then ask them to give me more mana. For some reason, the spirits won't just give me infinite mana, so I had to go painstakingly to each of the twelve spirits and ask for mana more times than I can count. Rinse and repeat and I am the new god of Mossar. <newline> What? Why don't I use my own magic to do this you say? Well, why would I cast magic when I can make twelve angry magic spirits do it for me in unpredictable and destructive ways? <newline> *Undyne, Lady of the Deep, listen up and lock Grace up in this tower.* <newline> Hahaha! Oh my stars! You okay there Grace? Undyyyne, why would you do this? What part of that spell made you think, "you know what that spell needs? Sharks!" Wait no, this is a fantasy world. Are those Leviathans? Oh God they're like beached whales. *Ignis! Quick! Fill the labyrinth with water!* <newline> Ok, so a sea of flame was not quite what I was thinking but this is so much better. Ignore the smoky human smell, I am sure they are fine. Wait, where's Grace? <newline> Grace? Graaace? Oh there you are, at the tippy top of your tower. How fares your kingdom your Majesty? \*Deafening roar of fire and distant screams\* Great! <newline> Anyways I think that does it for today. I hope you had fun, I know I did. Thanks again to the Gods for letting me beta test Mossar, it has been a real treat. I am sure Mossar will be fine, so I will see you next time.
“Hey man.” I said. <newline> The man looked absolutely dumbfounded, in spite of his illness. <newline> “This is the party that never stops being cool! I’m always happy to meet a fellow intellectual, Stephen.” I continued. <newline> “You’re a time traveler?” He asks in his robotic voice. <newline> “Yes I am. You’re the first to find out!” <newline> “When are you from?” <newline> “I don’t see it that way anymore. I came here from long ago but I was far ahead before that.” I explained. <newline> “How did you find out about this party?” He asked. <newline> “You are well remembered in my time. Three of your famous invitations remain intact and are kept in museums. I saw one of them on a school trip when I was a boy and made it my mission to attend.” <newline> “How do you survive the radiation created by warping space time?” He asks me. <newline> I chuckle briefly before responding. <newline> “I knew you’d ask that. It’s actually pretty simple.”
He couldn't hold eye contact with me any longer. Dad sheepishly lowered his head to stare at his fingers in his lap. I, on the other hand, sat across the table from him with my mouth still agape. My body felt numb and my mind was busy trying to grasp the concept of this new reality I was just presented with. <newline> After what felt like an eternity, I was finally able to force the words from my mouth. <newline> "It can't be true. Mom... it can't be true, right? This is a joke. This is an awful joke and you're not funny!" <newline> Mom refused to meet my gaze. Instead, she stared at the wall behind me with tears quietly falling from her eyes. <newline> "It's true." She whispered. <newline> "How? Why? Did you steal me from someone? Did you take me away from my real family? How selfish are you? Why would you do this to me?" I said through my own tears; emotions now flowing freely from my body like dam opened during a flood. <newline> "It's NOTHING like that." Dad responded. <newline> "Your mother and I took a vacation after our bonding ceremony. While we were on Earth, we were taking a tour of a city late at night. We were walking and..." <newline> "We heard the faintest, sweetest little cry from the side of a building we were walking past." My mother interrupted. <newline> Everyone fell silent for a moment. <newline> "You were in a dumpster." Mom finally continued. "We pulled your tiny, naked body out and dad wrapped you in his shirt. You were so small and so fragile; we were in love from the moment we laid eyes on you." <newline> "So we called the council." Dad added. "This wasn't something unheard of, but it was a special circumstance that needed to be discussed. We wanted to keep you and bring you back to Estacia with us. We asked for their approval and our request was accepted." <newline> "You were obviously unwanted by the human you were born from. We couldn't leave you there... we just couldn't do it." Dad said, while still avoiding my gaze. <newline> My world was crashing down around me. I had always known I was different. I knew something was off. My family towered over my 5'2" frame, with the smallest being my 14 year old brother who still shadowed me by an entire foot. My eyes were different too. Estacia is farther from our sun than Earth. It's darker here, and nearly everyone has almond eyes with large, black pupils to see better. Of course some people don't. My parents told me it was an "evolutionary anomaly" and I was considered "special". I also had pale, white skin while everyone else had a light blue hue to theirs. It was all beginning to make sense, regardless of how destructive the truth was. <newline> "We brought you home with us, and you immediately went into a six month quarantine." Mom continued. <newline> "But when we were finally able to bring you home, you fit right into our family. You were calm and playful. You were inquisitive and intensely strong willed..." <newline> Dad laughed. "Oh man, you were so ornery. We were fascinated by how different you were from every child we'd encountered here on Estacia. We bought you toys and adorable tiny clothes that had to be hand made. You were so incredibly tiny. We also started purchasing a premium food package so we could ensure your diet was full of things compatible with a humans digestive system." <newline> It was all beginning to make sense. I had never been to a doctor, though I can't remember ever having any problems that required one. My peers in school always gave me strange but knowing looks, yet no one ever dared ask why I was so different. That was not how social order worked here. <newline> "So what happens now?" I asked meekly. <newline> "Well, now that you're 18, we have to submit a petition to the Council for you to stay on Estacia." Dad was speaking to me, but it sounded more like he was trying to reassure himself. <newline> "They'll determine if you make reasonable contributions to our society. If so, then you'll be allowed to stay. If they deem you dispensable, you'll be returned to Earth to live out the rest of your life." <newline> Shock. My mind was shutting down. My entire body felt the need to bolt away from the table, from our home, *from our planet*. <newline> "Excuse me." I said as I stood, bowing to each of my parents as was customary after a meal or celebration. I retreated to my room to process their words and what this means for me. <newline> I had visited Earth once when I was 10. Estacia is different from Earth in that our society is united as One. Social disorder, fighting amongst ourselves and general misbehavior is practically unheard of. This was a stark contrast to my visit to Earth, where humans are spread apart, choosing to instead govern themselves based on geographical location. This creates tension between areas, with someone always wanting a war for more. One such area was the United States of America, where we had a treaty with their government for tourist activity. When you travel to Earth, you're allowed temporary entrance by the government territory that you're visiting. The general population of Earth doesn't even know we exist, and part of our treaty requires all visitors to uphold this by keeping their identity secret. Mom told me to tell strangers if they asked that we were from a place called "Utah". They said our dialect and language closely related to what they speak in the United States. <newline> I was enamored by Earth. My favorite place being the warm beaches my parents would take me to. They hated the hot, bright weather. You would often find them in a tent on the beach with a portable air cooler and dark glasses over their eyes. I, on the other hand, laid in the sand like a reptile; soaking the sun into my skin and melting under the warm embrace from the sky. I thrived there.
**Episode One (Or: my first day at school in Yokosuka)** <newline> Howdy viewers/readers! How are you on this fine and dandy morning? <newline> My name’s Clara and I’ve just moved from Austin, along with my parents and my annoying little brother Isaac, to Yokosuka in Japan. Pa’s job meant we had to uproot, but I don’t mind. In fact, it’s pretty exciting, right? I know a hundred people that’d kill for a chance to go move here! So — kinda for them, kinda for me — I figured I’d start a diary and frame it like an anime! What a hoot, right? <newline> It’s also kinda good to write this because I’ve had a few little problems with my memory in the past and this was suggested to help me keep track of things. <newline> Okay, intro over — let’s get this show on the road! <newline> Today was my first day at school and I reckon it was maybe the best day of my little life - no kidding! I met two girls who speak a little English (which is good cause my Japanese is about as useful as steak for a cow). They are called Akari and Sara and we’re going to be best friends, I know it! I also joined the Tea Tasting Club and signed up for the Swim Club. <newline> There is one girl I think I don’t like so much as she’s always giving me these little looks, but I think that’s cool. Every anime heroine needs a villain, right? <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> I kinda want to end the entry there, but this is also a diary so I’m just going to say that Mom and Dad still yell at each other just as much as before we left. I took Issac out for a smoothie this evening. I don’t think they’d noticed we’d gone. <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> **Episode Two** <newline> Oh boy, what a couple of days! Okay, so I’m starting to learn what a few words mean, which is cool. The school is really, really, really nice. Well, mostly. <newline> Confession: I might have been wrong about Akari and Sara. Akari seemed to trip me on purpose today and my lunch went everywhere! Why do I think it was on purpose? Well, Sara had her phone out and recorded the entire thing, and when I asked her to delete it she pretended she didn’t understand me. But her English was pretty good the other two days so I don’t know. I want to believe her, but also: could they be my real rivals, the mean girls who end up pushing me to greatness? Excited to find out! <newline> Still love Japan and my life here! <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> **Episode Three** <newline> Sorry I’ve not updated you in a while, diary (Dear diary? Reader? Viewer?) I’ve just been a lil’ distracted. Truth time: school’s not what I hoped it’d be like. I mean, I’m sure it’ll change, but right now I don’t exactly fit in well. But still, it’s better than home. <newline> When will I get my powers, dear diary? <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> **Episode Four** <newline> Mom’s gone. <newline> She took Issac with her. Back to America. <newline> She was right, he’d never change.People like him don’t. <newline> Why didn’t she take me, too? <newline> Why didn’t she wake me to say goodbye? <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> **Episode Five** <newline> Dad didn’t work this week. Just drank. Just like before we moved here. <newline> I miss Issac. <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> Quit tea club today after they ruined my uniform. You’d think tea stains would come out easy, but there’s no energy in me to even scrub at them. I’m going to have an early night. <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> Update: Dad is throwing things at walls and I can’ sleep. I feel odd. Different. As if my powers are finally coming through. I can feel them fizzing in my brain. I dunno. <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> **Episode Six.** <newline> Didn’t go to school today. I don’t know what I did, to tell you the truth. The whole day is a blank and now it’s night again. This used to happen to me sometimes back home. <newline> Maybe it was part of the reason they argued so much back then? <newline> And why we moved here. <newline> So tired.Going to try to rest more. <newline> Update: Dad yelling at himself again. He punched the wall a few times too. There are holes all over the place. Now he’s yelling about me, Mom, Issac. <newline> Can’t sleep. Feel strange. <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> **Season Finale** <newline> They’ll take me soon, I’m sure. They’ll be here soon. But I don’t think I even killed him? <newline> Sure someone did, but…Sorry diary, this will probably be my last update. I don’t think school will be a worry for me anymore. Not once they find out what I did. I’ll be sent somewhere else. Maybe back to America, I don’t know. <newline> The knife was in my hand but…. I don’t remember doing it. Honestly I don’t. <newline> I miss Mom and Issac. <newline> Did I do it? <newline> Was that my power? That someone stronger inside of me takes control? <newline> I don’t remember. <newline> I don’t remember. <newline> I don’t remember.
'I've tried to die a thousand times. I've jumped of buildings, breathed helium, attached steel manacles to my legs and sunk to the bottom of the ocean.' <newline> He looked young, with flawless skin and bright eyes, as if he had his entire life ahead of him. <newline> 'I have lived my span, and I am ready for oblivion, but it does not come. My injuries heal, the chains rust, even minor blemishes fade and leave me looking as if the anguish of my past never happened, and I cannot escape.' <newline> Henry stood there, aghast. 'I did not even consider how I might feel in a thousand years, let alone ten thousand, when I accepted this bargain.' <newline> 'This Faustian bargain, that it seems we can never escape. I'm sorry. I shouldn't burden you with the pains of eternity, when you have yet to taste the pleasures.' <newline> Henry precipitously reached out his hand and grasped Laurie's. 'Don't be sorry. You needed someone to talk to, and I am pleased you chose me.' <newline> 'Thank you, Henry. I appreciate it.' <newline> 'How about you join me for dinner?' Henry asked. 'You can give me the benefit of your experience, I can be a shoulder to lean on.' <newline> 'I would enjoy that, but only if we set aside the topic of eternity for now. I would come to know you better, and perhaps for you to know me.' <newline> He paused for a moment, and then continued. 'I know a delightful seafood restaurant just a few kilometres from here. Shall we walk?' <newline> Henry nodded his ascent, and they set off along the cliff side, walking in comfortable silence as they watched the seagulls soar. <newline> 'Once upon a time' Laurie suddenly said 'I tried to fly like a bird. I must have plucked a thousand seagulls for their feathers, and with wax made myself wings. It actually worked for a while, until I soared to close to the sun and the wax melted! I could have warned Icarus, if I knew what he was doing...' <newline> 'Surely that's not true' asked Henry. <newline> Laurie gave a small laugh. <newline> 'No, not at all. I did try to make wings from seagulls and wax, but when I leapt from the cliff I just plummeted to the ground, no matter how hard I flapped.' <newline> 'That sounds painful' replied Henry. <newline> 'The cliff was over deep water, so the landing wasn't too bad. Tearing the water logged wings off my back while drowning, on the other hand...' <newline> They continued exchanging humorous anecdotes until they suddenly found themselves being ushered into the restaurant and to a seat on the terrace. <newline> They sat for hours on that terrace, watching over the French Riviera, eating fresh seafood that was perhaps caught yesterday on the boats they now saw coming in to the harbor, and they talked. Henry listened enthralled to the stories of the past, while Laurie reminisced happily as Henry described the pleasures of the newly immortal. <newline> As the night drew to a close, Laurie slowly reached out his hand and grasped Henry's. 'Don't fear the future. You have many thousands of years of happiness before the burden sets in, and perhaps by then a permanent solution will exist.' <newline> 'And perhaps' he continued, gazing into Henry's eyes 'I have a few more centuries of happiness ahead of me too'. <newline> Henry reached out to grasp Laurie's other hand, and smiled. <newline> 11(12)/71 - Σ6,904
My power, my one power was useless outside of villainy. I didn't have super strength, speed, or toughness. It didn't take me long to regret ever using it in the first place. I faked my death 4 years ago, now I'm just an equipment operator at the local steel mill. <newline> Janis works at our local bank,two blocks away. After a few dates we started going steady. married a year ago. In three months I was going to be a father, and I couldn't be more terrified, what if I screw my kid up like me? <newline> But now, now I'm beyond terrified. The Mauler had come into my little town to stop Event Horizon from stealing the platinum catalysts from the local refinery. Like an idiot, Event Horizon decided to rob the local bank while waiting for the motor convoy. Like a bigger idiot, The Mauler was duking it out with her inside the bank. <newline> As I sailed my dirt bike over the police lines and skidded into the bank doors I think I felt my left shoulder dislocate. That was fine, as long as Janis was still safe. I stumbled through the lobby and around the fighting. Janis was huddled against the back side of the marble divider with three of her coworkers. I was almost there. <newline> Event Horizon loosed a black hole between herself and The Mauler. It was a horrible plan, The Mauler was immune to being moved unless he wanted to, all physical interactions just built up kinetic energy that he would deliver in his next punches. Unless she was trying to overload his ability to store kinetic energy. To my knowledge no super villain had ever tried that. And the reason was simple, unless you were hiding behind a miniature black hole, potentially setting off that much kinetic energy might dissipate as heat. Lots of heat. <newline> I stumbled and fell, sliding towards the slowly growing black hole that was already ripping pieces of the marble away from my wife's only cover. Both supers ignored me, assuming I would just be another statistic soon enough. I reached out to the cold void as I passes between them, my power winking into being. The shadowy scythe that I borrowed from Death slid through her ankles, snuffing her power out with her soul. The shadow in my hands vanished the instant I let it go, hoping The Mauler hadn't seen what went on partially behind the black hole. Janis would be fine. I crawled around the corner to hold her while we both cried. <newline> The Mauler came around the corner and stared at us for a moment. He locked eyes with me and glared. <newline> "Well that was a bit grim," the pun was even more horrible for the flat delivery. He knew. <newline> I started to gather myself , Janis didn't need to see this next part, but The Mauler waved me back. <newline> "Just stay down. Everything's going to be fine." A life for a life, apparently The Mauler had a stronger sense of honor than duty. I was spared having my new life shattered. <newline> It has been 4 years since my little sunshine was born. She seems happy. Today she manifested. She can make rainbows and light. She's nothing like me, thank the gods. A life for a life, I can be happy for that. My life in shadow for her life in light. <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline>
“Curse you Meteor Man. You stopped me this time but we will meet again.” I say as I sit in the back of the police vehicle. <newline> “I’ll be here waiting Dr. Blight. Now take him away officers.” As the “hero” slams the back door in my face. <newline> Off once again to San Marshal Supermax prison. Thank god, I need to go chew someone’s ass out for the piss poor quality of the armor. Pretty sure I got some cracked ribs from those punches. <newline> “Hey Dr. Blight, your acting has gotten even worse dude.” My friend Jacob, aka Acid Mouth, says as he comes up to meet me. <newline> “Up your ass with broken glass Jacob. You better suit up your getting it next week.” <newline> “Yeah, yeah.” <newline> Little confused, let me explain. The both of us along with many others are part of a government program called the E.N.E.M.Y. Program. Enter Nemesis to Entertain Mighty Youths. I know not the coolest name but it’s the best the idiots who run it can come up with. <newline> Years ago, out of nowhere, people with powers started showing up. From people with super strength like Meteor Man to speedsters like Blazing Bolt. The government got scared though that they would go nuts without the proper focus for their powers. So they started the program. <newline> Started with some petty criminals but that was proving to be boring for the heroes. So they started making actual supervillains like me. You get $10,000 for each “crime” committed minus the cost of any damage you actually cause. <newline> The real purpose though is to gather research on each hero. Find out a weakness or personal info on one and that scores you a hefty bonus. The higher ups use them to construct a doomsday plan on how to stop them if they go rogue. Kill one though by accident and you get killed on the spot. They may be dangerous but they’re still heroes. <newline> Anyway if you excuse me, still got to chew the ass of whoever crafted that crap armor.
"And...Why...are you here?" said the monotone voice as the young woman entered the room. <newline> "Well. for one, I work here boss" replied the young woman who knew little of what had happened earlier. <newline> "Really? How sure are you of that Ms.Pherson" said the voice as he still couldn't care to raise his head from his everyday paperwork. <newline> "I'd say 99, after all, I am one of the top performers in the last quarter, aren't I?" <newline> All the man could muster was a slight chuckle as the words "When was the last time you checked the boards Janet?" <newline> "I...But why?" <newline> The pen had come to an abrupt stop, as the head that was almost parallel to his paperwork rose up ever so slowly. <newline> No words came out of him as he just stared at her with a deadpan look on his face <newline> "What position am I in now? But there was a huge gap between me and that Jillin" <newline> "I even stopped a robbery just now" <newline> "You know what? I beat up a bunch of guys who wouldn't leave that old woman across my street alone" <newline> Ms.Pherson couldn't help but blurt out sentences one after the other. <newline> "..And these bunch of guys" said the voice "were they, by any chances, part of the hero syndicate?" <newline> Pherson couldn't help but think. "Could be", she said "they weren't in uniforms" <newline> "Not one I'd recognize anyway" <newline> The voice had a slightly irritated tone now "Do you know why we do what we do?" <newline> "We may be bad guys, or villains as the general public may call us but one thing we never do is to interfere in the other guys' business" <newline> "And now, the reason you're **57th** on the leaderboard" <newline> "57?" Pherson shouted in horror <newline> "But that's only 3 places away from being relegated to Class C" <newline> "And all it took was one phone call from the syndicate" said the voice <newline> "We may be the bad guys to the world. But we do, what we do, because we have faith in what we do is right" <newline> "We merely traverse on the other side of the grey area called morality" <newline> "Now to you they may be the bad guys, but to me, they are just my friends on the other side of a metaphorical town" <newline> "To be honest, all the syndicate wanted was a stern warning to you and a token apology" <newline> "But if the tables were reversed, I'd want more and that's why you're 57th" <newline> Ms.Pherson was visibly disturbed now. <newline> "Well, thank you L, I appreciate it. It won't happen again" <newline> A slight grimace appeared on L's face as he said "I know Ms.Pherson" <newline> "Oh, and you'll be helping the old lady from now for the next six months" <newline> "That should be enough time for introspection" he said as his head moved back down for his eyes to meet the paperwork.
The fall was spectacular, especially because no one expected a real death on set. The cameras even caught your final moments. Shame they won’t be allowed to show it, really. <newline> You sigh, rubbing your head. You’ve been waiting on this dingy platform for a while now, like something out of The Matrix but less cool, and your head is pounding. You didn’t know ghosts could get headaches... But since your hands are partly see-through and the stairs out always lead back here, you’ve a pretty good idea that non-corporeality has taken over. <newline> Must be an after effect of all that concrete. <newline> ‘This sucks.’ Your voice hisses and you continue complaining to the air, working up to one of your famous rants. ‘Can’t you come up with a better setting? This Platform to Hell is boring as shit. Shouldn’t there be succubi and whimpering ghouls or something, at least? Even C-movie directors could do better.’ <newline> You know your fate; the Devil’s agreements you entered in life were pretty darn clear. Your flailing arms rotate your light-as-paper body a hundred and eighty degrees. Then you pause. Death stands on the grubby white tiles, smoking a cigar. He looks like John Wayne. <newline> ‘Train’s coming,’ he drawls. <newline> Your eyebrows raise. ‘I don’t hear—‘ <newline> A rattle and a roar exits the tunnel ahead of a blast of air that knocks you the length of the platform. You see the driver’s eyes and they’re white, not black, and the single carriage is filled with cushy seats. A grandma knits on one; a scarf of alternating skulls and unicorns. <newline> ‘Get on, then,’ says Death Wayne. <newline> You stare. Consider. Then, with calculated drifts and the occasional curse, you lower yourself to the front of the train to look through the windscreen. ‘I dunno, man. If this is Charon, I’m a red carpet prince.’ <newline> You’re not. You were always too messed up for that. <newline> ‘I think I’ll wait for the next one,’ you say. <newline> Death Wayne shrugs, smokes his cigar, and gestures to the train. ‘Your funeral, kid.’ <newline> You frown, which is weird as that’s been impossible since you got that iffy Botox job. Your headache rises. The train doors beep; they never opened, and the grandma never looked up. The driver grins fanged teeth, and suddenly you think *maybe this isn’t the best idea after all*, but it’s too late and the train rolls forward with the same inevitability of that damn ground not long ago, and it passes *through* you and you scream as if your insides no longer exist but are telling you they do... <newline> The red fog of your second death clears. <newline> You are in a diner, 50s style down to the tinny music and the frozen, pinafored waitress. A woman sits across from you, rolling a pair of dice across slender fingers. She is pale, hairless, with a ring chain from her nose to her earlobe. Her eyes are purple. <newline> ‘How the fuck did you get in here?’ she says, flicking dice so they tumble through the air and back to her palms. Her voice is clear and deadly as cut glass. ‘I thought I turned off cheat mode.’ <newline> Your mouth drops. Words have abandoned you. <newline> ‘Never mind.’ The dice slam to the table. ‘Roll, kid, and let’s see what happens next.’
It wasn’t a bark so much as a whine. <newline> Chester Arthur Googins, 79 late of Ocala Florida, now just late, lay as still as a body can. Barrett Baxter Barkley, or Bee, as Chester called him, was the one whining. Chester had never been much for words previously, and was definitely short of them now. <newline> “It isn’t personal, Mister Bee. Is it acceptable for me to call you that?” The robed skeleton asked. <newline> Bee barked in the affirmative. <newline> “It is not personal. It is my duty.” Death said. <newline> Bee whined. <newline> “He was very old. And he was in very much pain.” said Death. <newline> Bee sat still, all except for his nose, which twitched sadly. <newline> “No. No. Of course not. You made him very happy.” said Death. <newline> Bee covered his face with a paw. <newline> Death looked both ways, as if anyone besides Bee could see or hear him. Then he leaned in, his lips (or at least where lips would be ) an inch away from Bee’s ears. <newline> “Frankly I’m not supposed to say this, but knowing you gave him three more very good years.” Deaths voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. “ I’ve seen the paperwork myself.” <newline> A soft whine. <newline> “Of course you were a good dog.” <newline> Another. <newline> “Of course he was a good man.” <newline> And one last whine. <newline> Death rose to his full height, bones creaking like a ship in a gale, cloak as dark as night, with two tiny suns for eyes. And death, the great and terrible, said “I’ll wait.” <newline> So Bee licked the face of Chester Arthur Goggins one last time, then curled up next to him. <newline> Death didn’t smile. He could only ever grin. He tilted his head to the side and listened to a voice that only he could hear. <newline> “He says to go on, to become an old dog. He’s got nothing but time now, and he is happy to wait.” <newline> And with that what was left of Chester Arthur Goggins went cold. Death left quietly, as he prefers to. And Barrett Baxter Barkley, or Bee, lay still and remembered endless summer days walking next to plaid socks.
“He had to have left something” the man kept saying as he went through the old green box. Purchase papers from 1915, 1941, 1963, and 1991... repair and cleaning paperwork, and “ha!” A false floor in the silk padding on the bottom. <newline> He looked again at the basic old Rolex, simple, elegant, with the brand new leather band, on the table next to him. Kind of small, he thought. 4 broken bands were in the box as well, tucked along a wall, all with heavy wear and snapped at the same point, by the buckle. Evidence locker had submitted the item as “broken band”, but here it was in front of him, brand new. <newline> Holding the old bands, he sees each is marked with initials but the initials don’t match any of the previous owners history or relatives... one of them has a crude Caduceus carved in it, another a skull, another a series of notches. He sets them inside to lift the floor of the box. Inside he finds 4 notes. One is written in pencil, in cursive, on old stationary and says “They Will Hunt You If You Use It”. The second, on Pan Am Airlines stationary, “the choice is not yours to make”. The third says “the angels are jealous, they don’t like losing power”. The fourth “the bill comes due” <newline> He didn’t care about the warnings, tho. This had been years in the making He had followed the case of the miracles in Alabama for years, but never connected the dots... he was always trying to track the victims of the apparent murders that followed them. When he saw the 12 years of data on the two cases overlaid though, he knew it had to be him. Silly reporter, you never thought it might be a paramedic? <newline> He didn’t believe it until he saw it. The old medic with the gray in his stubble, chocolate brown skin riven with scars and faded tattoos, on his knees in the grass, in front of the stretcher. So likable, old Joe, the reporter had interviewed him a dozen times. The young girl had been hit in the street by a distracted driver, and wasn’t breathing, the mother calmly accepting her fate with her other child in her arms... until one of the paramedics looked up and said “I think it’s time, Joe.” He was quick, too, with good hands... no one else saw him pull his nitrile glove off, anyway. When the girl awoke, spitting and coughing, he saw that ungloved hand pass over her head, and the blue light filtering through her brown eyes, he knew. <newline> Plans were already in place. Bribes at the police station and the morgues, used for years to get good stories and pictures of evidence. A stop by the Dr. Matthews at the city morgue left him with a story of a biker hit by a runaway freight truck tire, crushing injuries to the head and chest, just like the little girl. The swastika on his chest seemed all too perfect. Rico at the Hole had been ready to go for years after their conversation, next stop was the old Victorian trap house near the paper mills in town, a “gift” of $50,000 and one kilo each of pure cocaine and pure heroin. Old Joe was dead in two hours, beaten by muggers for his wallet. Not his watch. That was part of the deal. <newline> Three months it had taken for the evidence officer to get him the watch, after learning of its value, the original $100,000 wasn’t enough for her, but a visit from Rico had solved that. And now it was in his hand. Power. <newline> He savored the light creak of the leather as it bent into its clasp for the first time, lit a cigarette, and looked out the double windows to the crowded street below... so much planning for this moment, he thought, twirling his finger around a long piece of twine. What better time than now, he thought, and pulled hard on the string.... acting completely oblivious to the air conditioner unit from the next room falling into the crowded street, it’s mounts ripped off from his clever trick. Quickly balling the twine, he heard his wife screaming from the other room “is she ok? Oh my god!” <newline> He didn’t even look to his beloved wife as he ran out to the street, finding the teenage girl bleeding and still in the street. It felt so powerful as he healed her in his hands, he felt the light of the Lord himself, as her eyes opened and she looked at him so closely. A 60 pound machine dropped from 5 stories up, and she survived! It was everything he dreamed of. <newline> It was after his triumphant interview when the second ambulance team showed up and ran inside, he was still so full of glow when watching them in their work, not wanting to get in the way, as they were using the front entrance. But he knew the red hair, on the stretcher when it came out, just never seen it so bloody. Shock took him then, all through the conversation where he was told that his wife had fallen down the stairs on her way to come congratulate him, all through the funeral and probate process where she had been so kind to him with her amazing legal preparation making it all so easy. <newline> It was six months later that he finally opened the green Rolex box again, drunk and smelly, unshaven and sad. The watch was right where he had left it after taking it off that first night... opening the false floor, he found a fifth message, written in ink in old cursive, on the wooden floor of the box: <newline> “Choose Your Target First!”
I can't remember exactly when I knew music was different for me than everyone else. I mean I heard my instructor say music can influence your mood and make your work out stronger so I thought it was normal. <newline> I didn't realise most people dont double, triple or more their speed or strength with music until much later. <newline> That's when I realised I had something special. That music was power and I was its conduit. <newline> And it was only limited by my imagination. Like how it impacted me was based on a few things; <newline> How I felt about the genre in general (classical was elegant, intelligent and always moving. Metal was hard, reckless and chaotic. Rock was strong, confident and impervious to future worries.) <newline> Or the lyrics. If I took them literally or if I believed in the darker subtext. <newline> And HOW I mixed songs and lyrics could do some incredible things. I believe I can fly while being stronger than yesterday doing the time warp again. <newline> I was undefeatable .... but my technology was not. My headphones were still plastic and metal. Still able to be removed or broken. And without my technology I was just a regular person. <newline> I barely dodged his laser shot aimed for my head but it sliced clean through my headset and the left earpiece spun wildly to the ground. <newline> With only the instruments in my right ear mixed with my shock, I was no longer listening to "You can fly". My flying gone, I slammed into the concrete below, my left arm taking the brunt of the blow, a sickening crack and sharp pain overwhelming me. <newline> "HA. Pathetic. I didn't even hit you and you're defeated, broken and useless." <newline> I spat out my mouth guard, greatful it had stopped me from biting through my tongue. It also served another purpose. <newline> Music was the power and I was the conduit. When it played into me I became more. But if I let it flow through me then it could change and effect you. <newline> The time had come. All my playlist had been coded simply so I could say it with the mouth guard in - A1, A2 etc. But now .... it was time to play the one playlist that would be undefeatable but strange consequences would follow. <newline> He walked slowly over to me as I coughed up a glob of blood. I wrenched the jack out of the player with my right hand. I stared defiantly at him. <newline> "Date night mix" I wheezed out. <newline> A long moment of silence passed. Then soft piano came in. Bass. Guitar. I took a gasping breath and started to sing along. <newline> "Baaaaay bee. I'm hot just like an oven. I need some lovin..."
John was fast running out of energy and breath from the already 400 yard dash trying to elude this crazy pale-faced woman who was chasing him, and gaining fast. What kind of anemic ghostly-looking street person has that much energy? She just has to be on drugs. More than once the thought crossed his mind (how did it get there?) of simply laying down and surrendering to whatever it was she had in mind. <newline> He rounded a corner into an alley that dead-ended against a construction fence, but at the very end of the alley there appeared to be stack of cardboard boxes surrounding a tent-like structure. The space between he and the woman fast gaining on him was now reduced to half the space of the sprint that he'd have to make into the makeshift shelter he had just discovered. He quickly estimated if he didn't step it up, he'd be fighting that wretched thing in about 3 seconds, or twenty yards, whichever came first. He gave his lungs a huge filling of air and pressed his legs for that ever-elusive burst of acceleration. He made it through the cardboard wall and dove head-first into the tent, only to discover that it was occupied by another anemic-looking female. Did he just commit double-suicide? <newline> The person upon which he had just thrust his rude entrance immediately reached behind her and rapidly deployed a sawed-off shotgun. She pulled the flap of the tent slightly ajar and let loose a very loud, smoke-filled volley of lead into the pursuant's face, that temporarily blinded and deafened John. When the smoke cleared and John was able to re-focus his eyes, he realized the force of the blast blew most of the "thing's" head off. The head had merely careened and spun off into the alley where it had to have made a very nondescript soft puffy thud as if it were a dried coconut or something made out of paper-mache. John was amazed and horrified at the complete lack of any blood splatter anywhere. But he was even more thankful that the shooter obviously knew what was chasing John was a valid threat, and not a friend of hers. That saved John probably an hour or more of pleading for help or convincing his new friend of the danger. <newline> "What the hell was that thing?" he asked his newly befriended shooting saviour, which came out more like a pant, given the state of exhaustion he now found himsef suffering. <newline> "Vampire mate, city is full of 'em". she replied. "But that one was a bit more seductive-looking, don't you think?" <newline> John heard the answer but somehow it didn't register. "What....vampires?" He thought about finishing the sentence about how vampires are the stuff of old 70s horror classics and the even earlier cheap 60s dime-store tabloid comics, but he was simply too tired to say anything else. Besides all that, what about her strange comment about it being "seductive". It looked to John more like an anemic heroin-addicted 90s goth-reject. This new person must have some very strange concepts of vanity. <newline> "Yeah mate, vampires, I know it's hard to believe, but this place is crawling with them all of a sudden, and it only happened since sundown tonight, reason why I am still here, I am waiting for daylight to make my great escape out of here. You'll notice there's four or five of them heads laying around in the alley out there, mostly from damned fools like you stupid enough to be out after dark in such a foreboden place as this and being chased by them things. So, thanks for the shootin' practice!!" the tent girl mostly mumbled. <newline> "What happened to the others?" John asked, "and where are all the bodies?" sheepishly, after catching his breath and regaining some strength and measure of calm. <newline> "Others?" she replied, quizzically. <newline> "Yeah, the others that were being chased" John looked out the flap again and surveyed the alley some more. No bodies, just four husks of discarded heads, like the rest of the trash that was scattered about <newline> "They...uh...hell I don't know...as soon as they seen me kill 'em they took off! Why the hell are you hanging around anyway?" the shooter nudged him with the butt end of the shotgun making the very pronounced suggestion that John be on his way now. <newline> John pondered this reply rather suspiciously, given her initial fumbling of her answer. His professional interrogation techiques did occasionally payoff. But now he was faced with the reality that he was probably encroaching on this person's safety and peace of mind. He decided to be thankful for his new comrade's gunsmitthyness, and not force the issue any further....and make a graceful departure...like....the others....who were suspiciously... nowhere to be seen.... <newline> "well...thanks for saving my life..I guess....I'll be out of here".... <newline> "Wait!" the tent-person said abruptly. "You can rest here...I kind of like you anyway" <newline> She winked at him, and calmly, casually lit a cigarrette. <newline> "oh no" thought John "I am definitely not having tent sex in the middle of a vampire epidemic" the words thankfully did not find their way to John's tongue... <newline> ...but that little devil on his shoulder was already poking him in the side of the head with his pitch fork....(to be continued)
The hardest part was mastering the cloning process. That was always Cassandras specialty, always the brains as she put it. But I’d spent enough time in her lab, watching her work, assisting her where I could, that I was able to retain just enough. A starting point. <newline> The first hundred years were the loneliest, and the most painful. Slowly starving, without ever perishing. But at least I was never thirsty. Count your blessings, as Frankie would say. And he’d know, he’s the oldest of the immortals. He’s lived through every major war and conflict, hell he participated in most. If anyone knew what it meant to suffer and survive, it’s Frankie. So I counted my blessings. Thanked the Gods I survived. Thanked the Gods I had water, shelter, and the means and motivation to craft and build. <newline> The next few hundred years passed much quicker. The ache in my stomach became an old friend, ever present. But my mind stayed focused: I would see my friends again. Cassandra. Frankie. Brett. Javier. Lisa. Even that bastard Hank. <newline> I repeated their names in my head as I worked, knowing that they were out there, knowing that we would all be reunited. All I needed was an extra pair of hands or two. <newline> Everything looked right. All my tests turned out okay, if a little unpolished. But I knew in my gut, my empty, wrenching, gut that this would be the one. One clone, that’s all it takes to set my plan in motion. Build a society, and find my friends. <newline> I flipped the switch, and the gears turned and whirled, steam spread around me and metal ground on metal. Not as elegant as Cassandras design, but it was something. And so I waited. Hours turned to days which became weeks. As the machine cranked away behind me, building a perfect clone of myself. <newline> “Hello?” <newline> The voice stirred me from my sleep. A familiar voice. My own. <newline> “Hello?” It called again, louder and more frightened. <newline> I rose, brushing the wrinkles from my clothes, and stepped out of my shelter to greet myself. It was early morning, and the dew had barely settled. There he stood, just paces away from where I slept. The machine had pumped out a full grown copy of myself. The first of my society. <newline> I admired my work. He truly was a perfect clone. Fresh. Clean. Matured. Years of starvation and survival hadn’t yet affected him. He looked…delicious. <newline> Maybe the next one can help me reach my friends.
"Go on, look. See, I told you, a whole month, all for me. And furthermore, have you seen the parades they hold for me?" Pride beamed at his 'followers' as he looked over them from his penthouse suite. He was staying there to observe his month of focus, a truly remarkable act from these humans. With him were the other 6 of the 7 deadly sins, and each of them was mulling this over in their own way. <newline> "This is fucking BULLSHIT. I have done NOTHING but influence every single FUCKING human for, oh I don't know, eternity, and all I get is, oh look: FUCKING NOTHING AT ALL." Wrath fumed as he looked down at the people on the street. "They look way to fucking happy for it to be pride, they must be feeling something else...almost looks like...no yeah...they do look proud. FUCK." <newline> "All I know is that they are showing enough skin, they may as well be celebrating Lust month." Lust stood looking out the window. She had stopped loquaciously describing lavish lewd thoughts to exclaim this small truth. "Honestly, its like I'm there reveling in the debauchery." <newline> "No, no, look in their eyes. They are truly proud, albeit a bit under dressed, and showing their deep understanding of what that means! And look, I mean just look at their confidence! Normally when I choose a color, I try to be a little modest, only choosing what obviously looks best on me: Reds, blues, summer and winter colors, etc... But they, bless their souls, they decided that what better way to be proud than to just take all the colors!" Pride was beaming as he looked over the parade. <newline> "Yes...I've been thinking about that. Taking everything from others...happiness, after all they've been called the 'Gays', surely that means they are taking all the happiness for themselves. And all the colors, they are clearly gluttons who simply don't know what to call themselves. They may have pride, sure, but obviously they are just taking everything they want for themselves. Clearly gluttony." The fat sin sat back and watched as the parade continued. <newline> "Gluttony, look at them. They are fit as all get out, dancing constantly, and making sure they all look fit and fine as ever! How can one be gluttonous if they won't even eat Gluten?" Pride retorted, grinning from ear to ear. "Obviously they enjoy themselves, and they simply take what they want because it is their right as proud people." <newline> “Why...can't....people...just...ride....the.....cars...?...Why....must...they.....dance...and...run...?...Even...watching...them....is...exhausting..........” Sloth slurred as he slowly spoke. “...surely....we.....can.....help....them......slow....down....?” <newline> “Pride hides from no one! And runs wherever they choose!” Pride looked over Sloth. “I suppose you could never even fathom something as wonderful as being proud. You barely even move.” Sloth simply shrugged at the remark, choosing not to speak and instead remained silent. <newline> “If anyone deserved a parade it was me! I'm the one who inspired this whole thing anyway. I mean, these people are showing who they love, and its obvious that having a parade meant they were just envious of those people who were able to flaunt their relationships in public. And what do you mean Pride month is about you, Pride? This has damn near nothing to do with you! They are just being themselves and being happy after fulfilling their envious desires of equality! And you seek to take this from me? How did you even get your name on this ticket? Unreal!” Envy was turning a great shade of scarlet as he looked over the crowded streets. “It doesn't make any sense!” <newline> “Now, now, Envy, surely you know that just because you inspired something doesn't make it any more yours than it would Pride, and he is always one to take credit.” Greed checked his watch as he spoke, making sure the time was right. “If anyone deserves a month its me. After all, I make the world go round. Money, status, everything needed to make sure elections go the right way, the right people end up in charge, and the rich can keep getting richer. Though, I suppose I don't need a month when my way of life is THE way of life on Earth.” Greed chuckled, “I'll let you have this one thing, Pride, its all you'll ever get from me though.” <newline> Pride looked downtrodden, but only for a moment. “I would be sad, if I didn't have a thousand people walking in the street calling my name! Ha! Pride month, they should have thought of this a lot sooner really.”
The Cult of Fragon were assaulting our final fortess. Hundreds of my fellow followers of Shadran had died around us, trying to stop the approaching army. I was in the hall, using what little radiant power I had left to heal some of the guards, closing wounds so they could fight more. <newline> "Healer Lakras, your presence is requested by the High Priestess." <newline> I looked up at Brother Dalgan. He was pale, and had the same fear in his eyes I saw in my patients. <newline> "As she wills it." <newline> I looked down at my charge, to see his eyes go blank. I hadn't managed to save him. I stood, and wiped my bloodstained hands on a rag, before heading towards the Communion Chamber. I saw the High Priestess, holding an unfamiliar black staff. <newline> "Healer Lakras, you have served well. But it is time you were released. The Black Hand must be revealed." <newline> She held out the staff, and I went to take it, feeling the weight of responsibility settle around me. I had been the Chosen of Shadran. I was blessed, with 2 great wells of power. The Radiant font, was almost fully tapped out, after my work on healing other believers. <newline> But the Necromantic font was untapped, due to the horrific power it held. It was only a last resort, which we were now at. I held the staff, and felt the cold aura rise. <newline> "I will be the scythe that ends them. Shadran will feast well this day." <newline> I walked out of the Chamber, and went straight towards the upper walls. As I walked, the High Priestess' voice echoed throughout the fort, her voice shaking but strong. <newline> "Fellow believers. We will not die this day. The Black Hand is here. Our brothers and sisters, who gave their lives for us, shall be reborn." <newline> I arrived at the upper walls, marching past the guards. I looked down, seeing the fields of dead before me. I held up the staff, calling on its power. <newline> "May the blessings of the dark lady bear fruit this day." <newline> Black mist flew out, speeding down to the corspes below, filling them with a malevolent force. The first few rose, expressions of hatred and hunger on their faces. Others merged together, becoming abominations of twisted limbs, and broken flesh. They howled in pain, and charged the Cults forces. <newline> I fed more and more power into the area. Shades and wraiths were formed of the broken spirits, and it infested even the fallen cultists, turning them into the mockeries of life. <newline> The Black Hand had risen, and soon the world would know fear, of just why we kept it hidden. For as it flowed out, so it flowed in me. And soon I would be changed, into a creature beyond life and death. The true face of Shadran.
\*knock\* \*knock\* \*knock\* <newline> Director Ackerman looked up from his paperwork, the knocking at his office door bringing him back to reality. His mind had wandered off, most likely trying to escape the vast pile of documents that needed to be signed and letters that needed to be read, cluttered upon his desk. <newline> “Come in” he moaned as he stretched out his arms <newline> “Mr. Ackerman, Sensei Takahashi is here for your three o’clock meeting” <newline> “Ah, of course, bring him in. Thank you Patricia.” <newline> As the director’s assistant left the doorway, she revealed a much shorter and older man standing behind her. He walked towards the director’s desk, his long sapphire robes and luscious silver hair and beard flowing backwards with each step. <newline> “Sensei Takahashi, great to see you. Please take a seat” the director stuck out his right hand and grinned as he shook the calloused hand, which responded with a grip much stronger than his own. <newline> “Oh please Maxwell, just call me Hayato” the sensei smiled wide revealing a set of yellow teeth as he sat down in the leather chair in front of the director’s desk. <newline> “Er of course, well Hayato, I’ll get right to the point...as you have probably heard, the academy is getting a lot of complaints regarding our ‘Total Equilibrium’ policy following the incident between young Archy Whitman and Dmitri Jenkins.” <newline> There was a lingering silence. Director Ackerman was expecting Sensei Takahashi to respond, but he simply nodded his head slowly. The director quickly cleared his throat, then continued. <newline> “Well, and while I have always supported the training you provide to the children, after the injuries young Dmitri suffered, I need to address the possibility of shutting down the ‘Total Equilibrium’ program. It has proven to be effective, but now that a fifteen year old child is paralyzed, the risks and consequences of your teachings must be discussed.” <newline> There was another silence. Sensei Takahashi wore an expression of deep concentration on his now serious face as he stroked his elegant beard. His rugged hand dropped back down to his lap. <newline> “Maxwell, do you know why Archy became one of my pupils?” <newline> “Er well yes. He had been beaten up so many times by Dmitiri and his companions that the caregivers discovered him trying to kill himself in the bathroom one night.” <newline> Another pause occurred, but this time Director Ackerman swallowed hard as he got the feeling Sensei Takahashi was about to respond to his answer. <newline> “No child should ever have to experience the pain that Archy suffered for six long years, Maxwell. While Dmitri may have lost his ability to move, he was also responsible for stealing Archy’s desire to live. I believe that the results of their duel act as an epitome of the values that ‘Total Equilibrium’ represents, and the values that our academy strives to uphold.” <newline> This time during the pause Director Ackerman was not waiting to speak. He was at a loss for words. Although he agreed with everything Sensei Takahashi had just said, there was no way he could justify a fifteen year old kid being paralyzed by another. Now it was Director Ackerman’s turn to stroke his much less exquisite beard. <newline> “Maxwell, when you were a child, did you ever ecnounter an opponent that made your life more difficult?” Sensei Takahashi’s face showed a sense of genuine curiosity and care, something that was impossible to find during most of Director Ackerman’s meetings. <newline> “Well, yes” Director Ackerman was rather startled by the question, but the compassionate tone in Sensei Takahashi’s voice compelled him to reply. “His name was Jay Reynolds. He picked on me for most of my adolescent years. Would always bully me at school for playing the flute.” It just occurred to Director Ackerman that he used to have a love for the orchestra long ago. <newline> Director Ackerman tried to hide his slight blush with a cough, feeling like he revealed more than he should have. <newline> “Ah so he took away your love for music. Very tragic indeed” Sensei Takahashi was now shaking his head with a frown as if he were legitimately hurt by this news. <newline> Then Sensei Takahashi looked Director Ackerman in the eye, he had never noticed how powerful a glare the old man possessed until now. <newline> “Maxwell don’t you wish that as a young boy you could have stood up for yourself and protected that passion for the flute you had. And as you got older and reflected did you not wish that you could take something important from the Jay that afflicted you?” <newline> “Well... I guess...but, but it was my fault...I never stood up for myself back then, I was too afraid” Director Ackerman did not know why, but for some reason he was flustered. <newline> “See even now the actions of Jay have left you thinking your struggles were your own doing. He left you with a sense of hatred towards him and a sense of self doubt towards yourself. But, you are not a hateful man Maxwell, and you have nothing to doubt.” <newline> At these words Sensei Takahashi stood up. <newline> Director Ackerman was now deep in concentration, his hands folded in front of his mouth. He had no idea what to think, but he could not deny the influence that Sensei Takahashi’s words carried. <newline> Before heading out the doorway Sensei Takahashi turned around <newline> “Dmitri may have lost his ability to walk, but he also lost his ability to torment. Hopefully in time this loss will help him rediscover his empathy and eventually his soul.” <newline> Sensei Takahashi bowed and left.
Humans and safety is a long history, because as they say if you make something idiot proof they will invent a better idiot. Just about any piece of industrial equipment can become a weapon when misused. Most other species in the galaxy weren’t that creative to misuse or find the failure points in their technology. We took a different path than humans did. Finding solutions that were safer from the get go, that a culture of safety was not needed. <newline> First contact with the humans went something like this. We encountered their planet and found naked unshielded nuclear reactors, and factories still requiring manual labor. We then witnessed an industrial accident caused by some group advocating worker safety. They decided the best way to show the current methods were unsafe was to actively weaponize a chemical planet. This group decided the best way to do this was to sabotage a fertilizer factory. They found that the equipment itself would do more than enough damage to show it was unsafe the methods in place. <newline> However the activists underestimated just how much damage could be caused by their little piece of activism. Their stunt caused a large part of the planet to be uninhabitable by the release of powerful insecticides, and overheating a chemical reactor. Just a few simple changes in the parameters of the control program would lead to a mass extinction event. <newline> We had to step in and help them fix this after it damaged their atmosphere to the point of mass extinction. <newline> We attempted to provide atmospheric cleansers. This is where I come in. I was the overall lead in making first contact with the humans, and handling the uplift. This is my encounter in helping to provide training to the humans in the operations and maintenance of our technology. <newline> The instructions were relatively simple to follow. Make sure you empty the electrostatic catch basins, and clean the various intakes thoroughly. My first encounter with a human engineer was very illuminating in their design philosophy and how they actually protect people. They asked important procedural questions about lock out and tag out and how my people managed them. I said we didn’t because we are telepathic among ourselves. We know when someone else is operating on it, and what the next move of everyone else in our group would be. <newline> What we discovered however was that humans always look for the failure modes of technology, and how they can ruin the workflow. They found issues in how our maintenance is laid out such as they discovered inputs aren’t always checked and values garbage would be accepted. They eventually figured out that given the right inputs they could cause the cleansers to fail. We always viewed them as a relatively safe technology. It’s not something that could easily turn a world uninhabitable like a reactor or the various chemical synthesis techniques or a grey goo scenario. These garbage values caused the cleansers to remove the breathable component and could actually leave the planet uninhabitable for the oxygen breathing life on Earth. <newline> This led to humans being picked up as the official debuggers and QA team of my people. As they truly understand how a failure case (especially after the near brush with extinction) can lead to a weapon being unintentionally formed. Some people aren’t exactly happy about these debuggers, as they suspect they might be planting bugs or removing important features. However the safety we have gained as a collective team has had a great many benefits for all. We are rolling out this much more safe technology to our trading partners and it’s been very well received. <newline> A couple partners aren’t exactly happy about this new group being uplifted as many of them like their legacy systems and are worried about exploits being found by this much more qualified QA species, as most species who have joined our federation were not exactly creative (we only just recently discovered the term), and were very much sticklers to the rules.
Conducting a team meeting at 8am sharp seemed cruel, Jason thought. Perhaps there would be free coffee. After darting into this concrete nightmare of a building, with a half dozen elevators that didn't work, he had descended down instead of up, to the -13th floor. <newline> “We are totally going to hit our numbers today,” said Mr. Screwtape. <newline> There was not, in fact, any free coffee. Jason studied the empty travel mug he’d gotten for free at a conference sadly. <newline> Mopey, grey-suited workers listed on their heels as they all stared at their boss, each one’s face gaunt, surely from a lack of sunlight. A long-cheeked woman with a blazer the color of powdered scrambled eggs sat on her desk behind a gray cubical wall and smelled like a fresh fart. <newline> Jason wondered where and when his interview was supposed to take place. He’d gotten a letter to arrive here for his first day from his new boss, Screwtape, and had given himself plenty of time to get there. He’d kissed his wife, who’d completely ignored him, and straightened his tie as he did most of his life. But this day would be different. No more screaming at work and scarfing fast food alone at his desk and laying people off and faking giving to charity on his taxes. He'd make friends this time. Maybe even fuck a secretary. New job, new Jason. <newline> “Can I get a woo-woo!” Screwtape whooped. <newline> There was a half-hearted “woo” from the back. <newline> “C’mon, you can do better than that!” Screwtape said, with a shockingly vicious intensity that revealed teeth Jason could swear were sharpened. “CAN I GET A WHOOP WHOOP?!” <newline> This response was more numerous but equally half-hearted. <newline> “Now, Doubt won last week, but even her numbers were pathetic,” said Screwtape, pointing to a gray-smeared whiteboard behind him. It sported a lot of unusual names like ‘Pestilence’ and ‘Road Rage’ with a tally under each. “We are all going to get out there and make as many deals as possible. Really get into their heads. I want us to kick the ass of the other nodes. Screwtape’s team is going to be #1 in hell. Let’s get out there and get as many souls as possible!” <newline> Jason, who’d sipped his coffee cup only to remember it was empty, choked on air, “What?” <newline> Everyone turned to look at him. <newline> “Ah, newie’s here,” Screwtape said. “Everyone, this is Jason. Say hi to Jason.” <newline> A pockmarked man lifted his hand before it awkwardly sank away, but that’s the only greeting he got. <newline> “Newbie, two things to remember: One, coffee is for closers. Two, if you roll doughnuts and get no souls by the end of the day,” Screwtape flicked his tie and laughed happily, “we’re going to eat you like a slice of office cake!” <newline> As Jason looked around, the workers finally smiled at him, exposing their sharpened teeth. <newline> “No …” Jason said. “This is a bad dream!” <newline> Surely, he’d wake up next to his wife and kiss her silly before going to his normal office job. <newline> “You died yesterday,” said a short, squat man who was pushing a cart of dead printers. “Don’t you remember? By the vending machine. Sorry. No one was sad. You were a bad person. Welcome to hell.” <newline> Jason glanced back at Screwtape. <newline> “Better start making some phonecalls, buddy,” he said with a sharp-toothed grin. “You disappointed God. Don't you dare disappoint me, or it's cake time. So if you could bring as many souls in on this venture, that would be great!"
Even the best minds can wear out from too many failures. Being genetically gifted with intellect one would think that the world becomes a mere plaything once its subjected to its own rules of existence. Yet here is where I have for some reason or another failed. I'm not too sentient to believe in Gods or curses, however the constant dereliction of my well planned actions has abated my expectations. <newline> Take for example my XIRLO-15 virus that was supposed to wipe out half of the U.S. population. Instead of reaping through the American populous it has cured the obesity rate in everyone, saving millions of lives and enriching pharmaceuticals. I attempted to manipulate the economies of the world, yet people were taken care of by their respective governments though the U.S. continues to surprise me. I've even released enormous creatures to stomp out whole cities and they ended up absorbing the innumerable amounts of pollution in the world, keeping our climate stable for another ten years and ending their lives in the process. The world's heroes didn't even need to interfere with any of my well executed programs. Though the insufficiency of my carefully engineered schemes has finally taken a toll on me and its high time I leave the work to the more subpar, but effective villains of the world over. Perhaps a menial task would get my mind off of the epic debacles that have littered my otherwise short career in crime. <newline> After several days of contemplating where to begin my life as a part of the gentry I have decided that the best place would be a restaurant. Through research I have noted that these places are havens for "Karens" as the younger generations have dubbed them, women of pure evil and disgust. I just need one to speak with me for a few moments to formulate a suggestion on what to do as punishment for those who would speak ill of them. Oh, and here comes one now, I believe. <newline> "Welcome to Exotic Burger, how may I be of service?" <newline> "I want to eat the brat with wings", the woman states. <newline> "I'm terribly sorry ma'am, but we don't have brats with wings." <newline> "Don't correct me nerd boy! I know what I said is on the menu so you put it in there and get it for me!", she shrieked. <newline> "Yes ma'am", I responded. "Also if I may, what would you do to me if I could not get that for you?" <newline> "I'd talk to your manager dumbass. I know in China you fools would get shot if my ass complains, so you'd better get me my brats with wings." <newline> "Absolutely", I said enthusiastically. I'll have her ingest that chiroptera that I caught this morning for examination purposes. I can afford to lose one specimen to give this lady what she craves.
Being a good old-fashioned, red-blooded American, I approached the flaming wreckage in my backyard holding my shotgun at the ready. I would've gotten my .45 too, but that was in my bedroom and that got destroyed by whatever this thing was when it crashed. <newline> What *was* this thing, anyhow? Kind of looked like a spaceship. One of them UFO's the news is always talking about. I spit a wad of tobacco juice onto my lawn. It spattered off of one of the empty beer cans scattered around. <newline> There was a window in the side of the UFO. I peered through the glass and saw movement. Some kind of...aliens? I knocked on the glass with the barrel of my shotgun. <newline> The window slowly slid down. Two creatures were sitting staring at me wide eyed. They looked kind of like what would happen if an octopus and a frog had a baby. <newline> "What the hell are you doing on my lawn?" I asked. There was some beeping and then the frog-octopus answered. <newline> "Is...is my translator working? Good, good. Ah...we seem to have had an accident. Can you call us a respectable space towing company, good sir?" The second frog-octopus starting waving its tentacles and spoke to the first one. <newline> "Don't talk to it, Xeginald! It may have Earth AIDS!" it said. <newline> The first frog-octopus suddenly looked nervous. "Are we on *Earth*?" it asked the second one? "Oh my god!" Then it looked at me with fear in its eyes and said, "See here, good sir, please don't hurt us! My wife is pregnant with our 32nd egg cluster! I know you Earthlings are a...headstrong species..." <newline> Then the second frog-octopus cut him off. "Don't talk to it! Just give it your wallet, Xeginald!" The first alien pulled out a thin billfold made of some kind of odd leather and dropped it out the window. <newline> "Take this, you can have everything! Just please don't hurt us!" Then the pair began sobbing and hugging each other. <newline> And that's how I got those two trophies on the wall there. My cousin is into taxidermy and I think he did a real nice job on their eyes and tentacles. Almost still look alive. <newline> Never did figure out what to do with that wallet, though.
"Mr. Bezos? Can you hear me, Sir?" <newline> Ralph felt a light burning through his retinas, he tried to raise his arms to block but th wet were totally numb, he couldn't feel then at all. <newline> "Where am I?" His voice had the cracking gravel of the grave. He was in a white, textured metal room. <newline> "You'll be confused and disoriented for a few days while you recover. You were cryogenically frozen in 2078. The current year is 2214 by your reckoning, but we don't use that system anymore." The doctor drew light on the air as she spoke. <newline> The memory of what Ralph had done slowly came back to him. Removing the frozen billionaire's body, tossing it in the bio waste then entering the chamber himself. It has somehow worked. <newline> "Why cant I move my arms?" <newline> "I'm afraid nothing below your neck survived thawing, but this is a minor problem to fix these days. Most prefer synthetic bodies, and with your wealth, you can afford the best of the best." <newline> "Is that so?" Ralph, the man who had never owned a couch from anywhere but the side of the road, said. "Well, let's get started."
“Five wishes, I’ve got a good feeling about this.” <newline> “Are you sure?” The Genie has a concerned expression on his face. <newline> “Well, let’s see how the first wish goes.” <newline> And I winked. <newline> “ I wish for the wisest teacher in my universe to guide the rest of my four wishes each day.” <newline> “So shall it be.” The Genie intoned. <newline> “I wish to understand the separation between reality and consciousness.” <newline> “Did she tell you to make that number two?” The Genie playfully asked, “So shall it be.” <newline> Day 3... <newline> I really had to think about this one... <newline> some good lessons a long the way. Really good ones. Best teacher in the Universe I’d really wanted. Woo. <newline> “Figure our what you need for your third?” The Genie reminded me. <newline> Indecision had been most of my day. <newline> Ah, I think I understand. <newline> I ask. <newline> “I wish to understand Time in all its beautiful ways.” <newline> The Genie regarded me. <newline> “So shall it be.” <newline> Day 4... <newline>
She still thought about him. All the time. Why? She didn’t know. He had left her when she needed him the most. She ran her hand over her chest and took a deep breath. It was weird how simple things like a deep breath were joyous occasions now. He should’ve been here with her. But he wasn’t. When she had needed him the most, he had bailed. He had warned her. He had told her that he could never be a good husband. She had been naive. And in love. Fuck love. And fuck him. <newline> “Can you please put that out?” <newline> “Sorry?” <newline> “The cigarette. Could you please put it out?” <newline> “Oh sure, sure. I’m sorry.” <newline> “No problem.” <newline> There was a moment of silence as she looked out the window. Her driver had opened up a bit of it to get the smoke out and The wind blew through her hair, making them move around. Like Medusa, she thought. <newline> She had to confess that the area was beautiful. It was green as far as the eyes could see. It was quite a sight. <newline> “Are we close?” <newline> Her driver caught her gaze through the mirror. “We’re almost there. Five minutes at the most.” He turned his attention to the road. “If you don’t mind me asking, what’s someone like you doing all the way out here.” <newline> “I’m looking for someone.” <newline> “Ah. It’s a good hiding spot.” <newline> “It is.” <newline> She fell silent and thought back to the months she had spent searching. Money had not been an obstacle. He had left her more money than she knew if was possible for one person to have. For someone used to living month to month, the idea that she, and her next fifteen generations for that matter, would never have to work was pretty amazing. <newline> She had left her private jet behind and flown economy though. Old habits. <newline> “We’re here.” Her driver announced. “I always thought there was something fishy about him you know.” <newline> “There is.” <newline> “Is he a criminal? Like a murderer?” <newline> “No.” She looked at the little cottage for a while. “He’s the worst human being I’ve ever known but he’s not a killer. So he does have that going for him at least.” <newline> She paid her fare with a 200% tip causing the driver’s mouth to fall in surprise. She didn’t hear him calling behind her though and just kept walking. <newline> “Are you ever going to come in? You’ve been standing there for ten minutes now.” <newline> “You’re a bastard.” <newline> “I am. But I still make a mean tea. Come on. You’ve travelled a long way. Sit down, relax. We can get to the shouting and cursing afterwards.” <newline> Ten minutes later, as she sipped her tea and looked at him, she felt her anger starting to slip away. No! She couldn’t let that happen. She threw her tea cup down and watched it shatter into a million pieces. <newline> “Well that’s immature.” <newline> “Fuck you.” <newline> “Did you always curse this much or is this new?” <newline> “You left me.” <newline> He smiled and started picking up the pieces. “Nothing a little super glue won’t fix.” <newline> “Some things can never be fixed. You could try your best but the cracks will still be there. It’s unusable now.” <newline> “Well that sucks. Doesn’t matter. I’m super attached to this cup. You remember the coffee shop where we went for our first date. I gave them like a hundred bucks and asked them to set both these cups aside. I collected them later in the night from there.” <newline> She felt the tears come. “You son of a bitch. YOU LEFT ME.” <newline> “I did.” <newline> He turned around looking for more pieces. She wasn’t sure how this meeting was supposed to go. But it definitely wasn’t supposed to go like this. <newline> “Do you have anything to say for yourself?” <newline> He paused, a dustpan with pieces of his special cup in his hand and looked into her eyes. “Two things. I love you.” <newline> “You...” <newline> He held up his hand. “Second thing. I told you so.” <newline> The dam broke and she started crying freely. He went to his kitchen and put the pieces down. He started arranging them, his back turned to her. <newline> She got up and stormed out. She was only a few steps away when her anger reached a boiling point. Not like this. <newline> She went back in, walking straight to the kitchen and slapped him. He looked at her, a faint smile playing on his lips. It just fuelled her anger more. He was supposed to be sorry. He was supposed to be angry. Something. He was supposed to show some emotion. Anything but this.
##A Book from a Witch <newline> I walk into the used bookstore and stare at the old woman behind the desk. She is supposed to be in her sixties, but she easily passes for her early forties. The only giveaway is her silver hair, but it is sleek enough that it looks dyed. Everyone says she is a witch, and quite frankly, running a used bookstore in this day and age would require magic. I walk up to the counter. <newline> "I would like to see the forbidden texts." I say. <newline> "Kid, you got to be eighteen to see the erotica." she replies. <newline> "What, no. I mean your occult literature." I say. <newline> "What, why would we have that? Who would buy that?" she replies. <newline> "You mean you are not a witch?" I say. <newline> "No, I am not a witch. I swear being an unmarried woman in my sixties has brought out the worst rumors." she says. <newline> "Damn, I need some help on my Latin homework." I say. <newline> "Wait, why would you want to use occult texts for that?" she says. <newline> "To summon a demon for help." I reply. <newline> The woman bursts out laughing at my comment, and she sits down on her stool because she is laughing so hard. <newline> "You know what kid. I will tell you something. I do have some occult texts. One second," she goes into the backroom. I stand outside for a few minutes waiting until she brings out an old book. <newline> "Wait, why didn't you say that before?" I ask. <newline> "Because I was worried that you were a witch-hunter, it is hard being a witch. It will be twenty dollars." she says. <newline> "Twenty dollars!" I say. <newline> "Kid, the stuff in here could destroy the universe. Twenty dollars is a steal." she says. <newline> "Fine," I hand her the money and take the book. I open it to see texts in Latin, "Hey, you didn't tell me these texts were in Latin." <newline> "All spellbooks are in dead languages. You want a demon. You got to translate it. I will give you some help. You just need to translate the first ten pages and page 137. You will need to read it out loud so make sure to learn the pronunciations." she says. <newline> "Okay," I sigh. <newline> I run home and up to my room. I still have my Latin materials from class so I poor over them to start translating the texts. The materials from class are quite useful on this endeavor. <newline> The first five pages are about the creation of the Earth. It occurs in seven days. Wow, I didn't know the witches agreed with Christianity. Then, it goes into the story of Adam and Eve as well as the Garden of Eden. I stop for one second. I turn to page 137. The first sentence I translate reads: "No grain offering which you bring to the Lord shall be made withleaven." I go to the computer and type that into google. Sure enough, it is Leviticus 1:17. She gave me a Bible. <newline> The next day, I march into her store, fuming at her treachery. I slam the book on the counter. <newline> "This won't help me summon a demon. It is a Bible." I say. <newline> "Ahh, the horror," she holds her hands up in fear acting as if the sight of the book is scaring her. She chuckles and puts her hands down, "Yeah, it is a Bible. Some dude bought a Latin version of it in Italy because he thought it was a valuable antique. It was worthless so he dumped it on me for a few bucks because he wanted to get rid of his mistake." <newline> "Yeah, well, I paid you twenty dollars for it so I want my money back," I say. She rolls her eyes. <newline> "How long did it take for you to figure out that it was a Bible?" she asks. <newline> "I translated the first ten pages. I later translated page 137, by the way did you even know what was on that page?" I ask. <newline> "Not a clue, seemed like a good number. Well, let me ask you this, did you use Google Translate, or did you work on it with the materials?" she asks. <newline> "I used some Google Translate, but I also used the materials from class. I figured they would help me more with the pronunciation and the particulars of a language." I reply. <newline> "So in a way you studied hard to translate the book." she says. I stand in silence blinking at her. <newline> "I knew you wouldn't accept any Latin help I would give you so I gave you an old Latin Bible. You were so desperate for outside help that I figured it would force you to translate it." she says. <newline> "That is manipulative." I say with anger. <newline> "It is, but you were willing to summon a demon rather than buckle down and study. My god, you were doing more work to avoid sitting down and doing the work. I had to push you to study by your own volition." she says. <newline> I stare at her for a second. I did learn more Latin last night than all semester. <newline> "Alright, thanks, but I am keeping the Bible." I rush out of the store. <newline> "You already bought it." she yells.
**SCP #**: 6005, "The Mad Honker of Mulberry Glen" <newline> **Object Class**: Euclid <newline> **Special Containment Procedures**: SCP-6005 is to be housed in a ~~reinforced standard small animal containment pen~~ 10x10x10 self-cleaning concrete containment cube outfitted to automatically deliver food and remove waste. Vents, plumbing, delivery and waste elimination chutes are to be secured by seamless bolting to walls and floor, and vents to be further secured with wire capture nets capable of being remotely electrified. Any personnel interacting with SCP-6005 is to wear provided zipless, pocketless jumpsuits, remove all objects worn on the body (including jewelry and medical devices such as hearing aids) and only carry necessary objects into SCP-6005's enclosure. SCP-6005 is permitted a small number of enrichment objects (stuffed animals, plastic cups, etc.) as a means of deferring its destructive behavior. <newline> **Description**: SCP-6005 is an average-sized, male, white Emden goose. It possesses no abnormal strengths or abilities, but is uncommonly intelligent for its species, possibly meeting or exceeding average human intellect. SCP-6005 is actively antagonistic towards humanity, although its small size and fragility relative to a human limits its ability to cause direct and lasting harm. SCP-6005 recovers from illness and injury at an accelerated rate, and is apt at avoiding harm through the use of dexterity and intimidation, but it is unknown at this time whether these qualities stem from an anomalous source. <newline> SCP-6005 is a malicious prankster, and it will actively attempt to disassemble any human-made object and cause nearby humans embarrassment and physical harm for no other reason than apparent joy in the act of causing pain. It directs every waking moment to the destruction of property and the causation of pain, prioritizing mischief over all other needs, including feeding, sleeping and mating. SCP-6005 possesses several skills that aid it in its tasks, such as lockpicking, stealth, and expert-level knowledge of intimidation and human psychology. <newline> As of 10/12/2019, SCP-6005 has been the instigator of ~~4~~ 7 separate containment breaches. <newline> **Discovery**: After receiving reports of a "thrice-cursed devilish hooligan" haunting the residents of the English town of Mulberry Glen, Agent Swann redirected her usual patrol route to investigate the town. While driving through Main Street, Agent Swann noted the boarded-up windows, closed shops and downed power lines endemic to a community in terror and called for backup prior to investigating on foot. After searching all public roads, Agent Swann found no person present on the street or willing to open their doors to discuss the situation; those who spoke through closed doors appeared to be in a state of delirious terror, with more than one remarking that the Agent might be "that devil bird learned to speak English". <newline> Upon returning to her vehicle, Agent Swann discovered the brake line severed, all four wheels flat, the front bumper removed, one window broken, and the contents of a nearby garbage bin upended into her passenger seat. While investigating the vehicle, Agent Swann's service revolver, wallet and reading glasses were stolen from her person. Upon discovery, the Agent searched the area for the perpetrator, catching a glimpse of a small, white body rounding into a nearby alley, but was prevented from giving chase due to her shoelaces having been tied together. Upon impacting with the pavement, SCP-6005 emerged from its hiding place, stole her left earring, honked in her face ("with extreme prejudice", as reported) and fled into the abandoned streets. <newline> Upon removal of her shoes and treatment of her skinned chin and bleeding nose, Agent Swann located the single public phone left connected in Mulberry Glen and phoned the local Foundation dispatch to update the incoming agents. While within the booth, SCP-6005 reappeared, wielding Agent Swann's once again tied-together shoes like a bola, and proceeded to beat against the door and walls of the booth while honking and hissing. Due to her continual reporting of her situation, MTF Kappa-88 ("Lord British Postulate") arrived on-scene in under ten minutes and subdued SCP-6005 with a combination of small animal tranquilizers and watercress sandwiches. <newline> Upon recovering her shoes, Agent Swann noted a large amount of bird droppings concentrated in the right toe. <newline> **Addendum**: On 10/01/2019, after receiving no fewer than 14 separate inquiries from Researcher Hayes about the validity of SCP-6005's Euclid designation, he was invited to enter SCP-6005's containment cube and perform the standard Foundation Anomalous Abilities Tests. No further inquiries have been made by Researcher Hayes, and personnel are instructed to report the discovery of his hairpiece if it ever emerges from the waste disposal chute.
<newline> The doors swept open in time with the trumpet fanfare. The gathered nobles bowed in unison as the King swept into the room, his fur-trimmed white robe trailing a full ten feet behind him. <newline> “Caravax, Third of his Name, King of Elora, Lord of the Seventeen Seals, Champion of the Tower and the Holy Avatar of Riyala.” <newline> “You forgot ‘Protector of the Silver Fortress’” Caravax stopped and glowered at the herald. <newline> The herald blinked and looked at the man beside him who stepped away, suddenly interested in anything else. “The, Protector of the Silver Fortress!” The herald added with as much pomp and flare as he could. <newline> The king scowled but nodded and turned to take his thrown but then stopped and turned back. “It’s just that why have all these titles if your herald doesn’t say them when you enter the room?” <newline> “Of course, your majesty. Slip of the mind. Won't - won't happen again. We could start again if it would please you.” <newline> Caravax sucked on his teeth but shook his head. “No, that’s ok. I’m not a vain man.” <newline> He turned to approach his throne and stood while two attendants fixed the train of his robe to allow him to sit. He took a wine goblet from a pillow and nodded at the herald. <newline> “Captain Ellen Forrester of the order of Paladins and-” <newline> “That’s fine,” Ellen silenced the herald with a quick step. “Majesty, I have discovered something that requires immediate and decisive attention.” <newline> “Were you attacked by a horde of last season’s fashion?” The king cackled, looking around to ensure his nobles were also laughing. <newline> “No… No,” Ellen stepped forward. She was wearing simple leather armor, with the circled x sigil hanging on a chain. “We raided the Seeded Scepter last night.” <newline> “The poor people tavern?” <newline> “We traced the scourge of the Dragon’s Kiss potion there, Majesty.” <newline> The king sat back slightly, “Go on.” <newline> “The Dragon’s Kiss is the potion that fills its consumer with euphoria, and then rage, and then, amazingly, invisibility. It's wreaking havoc on the lower city.” <newline> “I know what it is, go on.” <newline> “We raided the tavern and found a laboratory in the basement, it was… Majesty in all my years never have I seen such horror. To make the potion it seemed they were-” <newline> ‘That’s quite alright, I don't need the details. Thank you for the report and-“ <newline> “Majesty, there’s more, if I could.” <newline> “I don’t think that will be-” <newline> “We found evidence that the kingdom of Grell is behind it.” <newline> The king arched an eyebrow over a stubborn frown. “Grell?” <newline> “Grellish marks. Letters from the caption of the serpent guard. The Grellish standard in a lockbox, as if waiting to be unfurled.” <newline> “Well that is very interesting, Captain and I appreciate the report and I will think hard about what you’ve discovered.” <newline> “Majesty, I know they are our allies. But the evidence is clear. Grell means us harm and we must respond. We must raise the banners and march.” <newline> The king took a breath and let it out with a simple, “No.” <newline> “No?” <newline> “No, we will not be doing that.” <newline> “Majesty, I don’t understand.” <newline> The king licked his lips and looked away as if affronted by a foul odor. <newline> “Seize the captain, put her in chains, and give her a cell to await execution!” <newline> “What?” Ellen staggered backward. <newline> “A traitor!” The king hissed. “She’s betrayed us! You heard her words! Take her! Take her to the thrice-damned dungeon all ready!” <newline> The two closest guards exchanged a confused look but at the king’s tirade, they hurried to carry out the order. <newline> Ellen didn’t resist as the guard bound her hands with rope. <newline> “I discovered one more thing,” Ellen said with a smile for the king as they led her out. “The emeralds of the fountain will fade” She bowed as she passed the king of Elora, protector of the realm. “Your majesty.” <newline> The king paled at the words but no one else seemed to have any idea what she was talking about. After a creeping silence, the king seized his wine goblet and emptied it with a splurging, curling laugh, looking around to encourage the others to laugh also. <newline> King Caravax, third of his name, held out the goblet to be refilled and once it was, took his seat and said, “Right then, who’s next?” <newline>
"Please, I want to get on my feet." <newline> This should be fun. <newline> With a slight hand gesture, the soft spring breeze blows a crumpled $20 bill right into the man's lap. A smile appears on his face, and I hear him think: "I'm going to treat myself to a nice coffee!" He gets up, and I quickly scan the area for coffee shops. He's probably going to the nearest one, but the one two blocks over has a vacancy. I snap my fingers and oops, the coffee shop's electricity goes out. Not for too long, just long enough to get our guy on his way over to the other place. There he goes. <newline> The manager of the other coffee place is sitting in his office, reading the paper. As a guilty pleasure, he starts looking for the horoscope. I smile, wave my hand, and his horoscope now reads: "take a chance on those less fortunate than you, for you yourself could be as unfortunate one day". He thinks nothing of it, as he gets up and returns to the front to relieve his staff on their lunch break. <newline> When our homeless man reaches the front of the coffee place, I snap my fingers, and the door gets stuck - just long enough for him to notice the "looking for a waiter" sign. He pushes a little harder, the door opens, and as he orders his coffee, he asks about the job. "Well," the manager says, "you know what, if you get yourself cleaned up by this afternoon, you can start." The man stares at the $20 bill and back at the manager, who is now handing him a coffee. "And this one's on the house", the manager smiles, as he waves off the bill. <newline> He goes back out, warm coffee in hand, and starts walking around. "I'll need some clean clothes," he thinks, "and my hair needs to be cut." The only hairdresser in this area charges $40 for a haircut - "that's twice what I have..." the man thinks, as he sits down on a bench, next to a young woman. I listen to her thoughts, and hear she is an hour early to a job interview and SUPER nervous. I think for a second and... with a wave of my hand, rain starts pouring down. Only for a short while, but long enough to completely ruin the young lady's hair. "Oh no, my hair, what do I do now?!" she starts panicking, and it is at that moment that our guy notices a sign in the hairdresser's window that says "1 haircut $25, 2nd 50% off!" He could've sworn that sign wasn't there just a minute ago, though. <newline> "Um, Miss?" he musters the courage to say, "maybe you could hop into the hairdresser's there and have him dry you up?" She takes a moment to process that, and calms down. "Thank you, what a great idea! Is there any way I can thank you for helping me out?" He nods. "There is one thing..." They walk into the hairdresser's, and as they sit down for their haircuts, they start talking, and notice they have a whole lot in common. Not wanting to press his luck, and also not having a phone, he decides not to ask her for her number. She looks disappointed, but she's too shy to say anything about it, so they split the $37.5 and part ways on their way out. <newline> Except... our man notices a bag of clothes on a chair near the exit. "Um, Sir? What's this about?" he asks the hairdresser. "Oh, that's a bag of my old clothes. I, err, gained a bit of weight, and my wife thought it was time I took those down to the donation box. Except I've not had time to go out today." "Would you mind if I took them down there for you, Sir?" The hairdresser realised what was going on but, eh, no harm in the man getting a few pieces of clothing for himself if it meant he didn't have to go down to the donation box himself, right? "Help yourself, man." <newline> Inside the bag, he found a lot of things he never possessed before: a vest, a proper shirt, pants without holes in them, warm socks, and... swimming trunks? Oh, yes, those were part of my plan as well. "I haven't gone swimming in ages, maybe I should stop at the swimming pool on my way back". And as if it was, well, *my* will, the swimming pool just happened to have a $1 entrance fee day. What a coincidence. Our man took a long shower before going in for a few laps, and another long shower when he came back out. He dressed in his new outfit, dried his hair and went back on his way to the coffee shop. <newline> Time for my last trick. Upon arriving there, he notices something he hadn't noticed before: a sign advertising a small 1 bedroom studio upstairs from the coffee shop. He goes back in and asks for the manager, who comes back out as soon as he hears our man's voice. "To be honest, I didn't think I'd see you again," says the manager, "I'm pleasantly surprised. Can I offer you another coffee while we talk about wage and hours?" Our guy nods and smiles. <newline> The two men sit down and, our guy being an honest guy, is upfront about his being homeless, and asks if it's maybe possible that he rent the upstairs bedroom as part of his wage. "I thought as much," said the manager, "and of course I want to help you out. After all, it might be me who is unfortunate the next time, right? Can you start tomorrow?" he asks, and our guy nods. "Then let me take you to your room, so you can settle in." <newline> The next day, on his very first shift, our guy does a wonderful job. He seems to have a natural knack for it, or maybe he's just lucky that he's getting the easy customers with the easy orders, who knows? Right before his lunch break, a woman walks in and orders a café latte. "Wait, aren't you the guy from yesterday?" she gasps, "I'm so happy to see you again!" He blushes and asks, "would you care for some company? I'm about to go on my lunch break." <newline> I look at them, and I smile. That's it for me. He's got it from here.
She elbows me in the side. “Say I do.” The words come out a hiss and from my periphery, I can see her eyes drilling into me. <newline> “I do,” I say with confidence. I do love her. I just wish I knew where we were in the ceremony. Were rings next? Or was this the dance of daggers she had mentioned in passing yesterday during rehearsal? <newline> I loved Elvira more than anyone I had ever met. She had that sparkling wit and charm that had drawn me to her, and somehow it never dulled. It seemed she always had a ready word for any situation, able to wow me with her brilliance. She knew just what to say to turn a gloomy day around. After I met her, it began to feel like things just went my way. That promotion came through, my landlord got off my back. My good luck charm. <newline> I take a deep breath and refresh the smile on my face. I hate standing up here in front of her family. I really wish I had the chance to meet them before today, or could see them now. But the thick black veil between us and them keeps everything cloaked in shadow. Elvira assured me that we would all get a chance to meet after the ceremony. <newline> “They’re going to love you,” she said, stroking my hair and doing her best to soothe those worried thoughts. <newline> When I proposed, she said yes with no hesitation and started planning the wedding right away. My friends told me it was all too soon, but they had never met someone as magnetic as Elvira. I could not and cannot imagine a day of my life without her. Still, when she started explaining her local traditions around the wedding, it took some getting used to. <newline> Her country does things different, I reminded myself, but that does not mean they’re wrong. Besides, she looked stunning in her dress, even if it was a smoky gray. I would have preferred a tux for myself, but I was happy to wear the cloak she selected for me. What did it matter what I wore when I was marrying the most perfect woman in the world? <newline> Another nudge. “Take the cup,” she hisses so that the attendants around us cannot hear. It is an ornate thing, gold and jewels. Last week, she had told me it was her culture’s equivalent to communion. <newline> “But I’m not religious,” I said. <newline> She smiled that winning smile. “Don’t worry, it’s not like that. Just symbolic.” <newline> Now I lift it to my lips; the metal is startlingly cold, but I can’t drop it. Just what I need, to spill—what is this? Wine?—all over the ornate rug and my betrothed’s gown. As I swallow, it’s thicker than I expect. The cup has lent a metallic taste to it as well. But I smile through it. It’s all for her. <newline> The officiant takes the cup back with a wolfish grin, then returns to the droning speech. His words slip and slide over one another, full of strange stops and slithering sounds that I am sure would tie my tongue in knots. No wonder Elvira told me I didn’t need to learn it. I do wish Google had found some results for “I love you,” though. That would have been a nice surprise for her. <newline> Elvira doesn’t drink. “Some weird, patriarchal shit,” she had told me with a wave of her hand. But I remember her saying that was near the end of the process. Which is good, because I can feel my head starting to swim from standing too long. <newline> Relax your knees, the words echo to me. I bounce a little, but the fuzziness remains. <newline> He still goes on, looking out at the sea of faces concealed behind the curtain. I wish I had someone out there. But a destination wedding was beyond the budget of my broke friends, and I hadn’t had family to speak of for years. At least I was getting a new family. <newline> I wonder if they spoke English. Elvira told me not to worry, that communication wouldn’t be an issue at all. I’m so lucky to have had someone so patient guiding me through all of this. My heart beats a little faster as I realize, again, that I get to spend the rest of my life with her. <newline> The officiant pauses in whatever part of the ceremony we are in now and brings forth an ornate box. There are crossing lines and swirls engraved on it. The smoke from the candles is making my eyes water, and the effect seems to make the lines squirm over one another. I blink away the tears, but it does nothing for the smoke or the muffled feeling in my head. <newline> Now Elvira pulls a dagger from the box. This is what she mentioned. We turned to each other, and she’s radiant. Her face seems to glow, and she’s the only thing I can see. God, I love this woman. I’ve been unsure of a lot of things in my life, but for once— <newline> The pain is dull, not nearly as sharp as the knife would insinuate. I am more an observer, watching the red bloom across the front of the cloak she purchased for me. She had wrapped it so gently and left it on our bed. Her face was warm then as it was now. <newline> I’m on the floor and the blood is getting on her dress. It was beautiful and I’ve ruined it. The edges of the world are darkening, the curtains closing in around us. And above me, there is something writhing and amorphous. The candles can’t be smoking that much? We’d burn the place down. <newline> The smoke fills my lungs, choking out the last gasp of oxygen I had. And there is something speaking in my mind now, those same slippery sounds the officiant used. <newline> Elvira cradles my head, eyes still loving. “Rise, my Lord,” she intones in that language I did not know a few moments ago. <newline> Someone else stands in my place and the hall breaks out in a chorus.
Hunt Tower Apartments had been condemned sixty years ago. Murders. Nine, to be precise, with at least twenty more deaths in the blaze that was started during the apartment building's hunt to find the murderers. <newline> Most of the residents that survived ended up getting committed saying aliens made them do it, or witches, or devils, and the building stood, not safe to be inhabited, but never torn down. <newline> Brandon Cordeaux hesitated to step across the threshold into the lobby. He had it on good authority that the building probably wouldn't fall down on him while he investigated the tip that had been sent to the precinct that morning. A middle-aged man who said he didn't believe in ghosts, but there were lots of lights and screeching late last night, *wrong* music of some kind, reverberating across the whole street and normally he would have been asleep at that time, only he was having back problems you see, and so he looked out the window and saw all the lights in Hunt Tower and heard the sounds, and he was fixing to call in the complaint you see, but then it suddenly stopped. The lights ended and the music halted and the scorched window frames were dark once more. The man didn't believe in ghosts, so he waited, watching to see who came out of the building. He waited until dawn, and no one came out of the building, so he figured they must still be in there, only the sun came up and he could see into the building, you see he can always see into the Hunt Tower, and it was empty, not disturbed, didn't look like a soul had entered, and he could tell because of his binoculars that he uses to birdwatch from the roof sometimes. Cordeaux only got the man to stop talking by promising to investigate Hunt Tower himself. <newline> And so Cordeaux found himself stepping into the lobby of the condemned building, the only condemned building in a suburb of one hundred thousand, an apartment building that was supposed to attract people to work in the failing city ten miles north. It had apparently only attracted crazies. <newline> Surveying the lobby, Cordeaux suspected that looters had raided the building a long time ago and that it hadn't been touched since. A layer of dust thick enough to cut with a knife laid on everything in the room, which was only a desk that had been bolted to the floor and the floor itself. His boots left sizeable imprints on the undisturbed dust, like the astronauts on the moon, only this dust was probably made of burned-to-death people. Cordeaux cut off that line of thinking before it got too dark. He had surveyed plans for the building before coming here, and he knew that the only way in and out was the lobby. Archaic design, to be sure, but effective, since everyone would have had to funnel past the little store, of which all that remained was the walls sectioning it off, convincing people to buy a pretzel or a coffee on their way to work. Cordeaux had walked around the edges of the building before entering to affirm the veracity of the plans. Only one way in or out of the building. <newline> The building's twenty-five floors were all laid out the same. Apartments along the edges of a patio-style area that probably housed a coffee stand or some couches. Fifty per floor. Cordeaux couldn't find any record of how the structure of the apartment had changed from the fire, but observing that the lobby seemed unchanged and undamaged, he proceeded cautiously into the first hallway. A row of elevators sat at attention, no current since the power had gotten cut here, doors closed, so who knew what floor they were actually on? Hunt Tower Apartment's symbol, basically the initials but with the T much larger, designed to look like the apartment building, vaguely phallic in appearance; an older person had probably designed it, not seeing the inevitable teenage graffiti opportunity. <newline> A small placard over the door announced the plaza, and Cordeaux decided to take a look there before finding the stairs and moving upward. His breath caught and he stumbled into the door frame as he saw what was on the other side of the door. <newline> The plazas of the various floors had been hollowed out, so Cordeaux could see to the roof of the building. There was no debris of this destruction, but he could tell that it was not intentional, seeing into apartment rooms open to the air. Dust covered everything in the room except a spot in the center. Cordeaux unholstered his sidearm and walked cautiously toward the center of the room. He couldn’t see what was there until he got closer. A circular platform, a stage of some kind, without a speck of dust on it. Cordeaux couldn’t tell what material it was. Some kind of metal or plastic. He looked around the large room, swinging his sidearm with his gaze, but nothing stirred. <newline> A single sheet of paper laid on the circular platform. It was written in English, evidently hastily, uncertain dots above i’s, lopsided p’s, et cetera. Cordeaux picked up the paper and read it. <newline> “People of the past, <newline> I never thought so much would change in a year. This is it for humanity. We stole this from them, from the Hunters, the invaders. They hunt through time and space, trying to devour entire species. You are standing on a warp tunnel. It only works here because the Hunters already tried to open a warp here but failed, about sixty years prior to this time. We are doomed. We are only able to send this here, to you, in the hopes that humanity can persevere. This was the first place that the Hunters tried to infect, to drive people mad to kill each other, but since it failed, they moved elsewhere on the planet before continuing. If this works, and by any deity in the stars I hope it works, you have a day or two before they actually make it through the warp here. Use this to GET OUT. You will be refugees, but you will not be dead. I wish there was another way, a way to drive them out, but there isn’t. Just” <newline> The letter ended there. Cordeaux wondered how the pranksters had pulled it off without disturbing the dust. This science fiction baloney, how could anyone believe it. He crumpled up the paper and threw it, striding away from the platform. <newline> A switch clicked under his foot. <newline> A beam stretched upward from the platform, all colors at once, an onslaught of visual sound and multiple dimensions crashing into each other, the antithesis of time and space. Cordeaux understood this at once, gazing into the laser light show. He unloaded a round from his sidearm and threw it cautiously into the swirling vortex. He threw it hard, so it would come out the other side. He heard a whoosh and a pop. Nothing came out the other side. Cordeaux did what any sane person would. <newline> He ran. <newline> He ran for his life out of the building, wanting to leave whatever gods were playing here be. <newline> He emerged from Hunt Tower to see his city on fire. No sirens. Just fire. He saw a person running towards him. A woman in her thirties. He thinks he had seen her at the gym before. <newline> “What’s going on!” He yelled, though there really wasn’t that much noise, except the whooshing of fires and some screaming. The woman looked terrified. “My neighbor went crazy’s and stuff started burning, and—“ <newline> An explosion farther down the street silenced her. A black mist swirled out of the hole in a building, an old office building, some lawyers and doctors who Cordeaux realizes are probably dead. <newline> He made a quick decision. “I think I know a way out of this,” he told the woman. He didn’t grab her hand like in the movies, but they ran together, kicking up dust, almost choking on it, into Hunt Tower. The woman gasped at the light show from the platform, but she made the same decision Cordeaux did, and they ran, and jumped for good measure, and there was a whoosh and a pop and then— <newline> White. A white room, with white walls and no visible door. Dust floated off the odd pair, marring the white. <newline> One of the walls became a large screen, and Cordeaux and the woman started. Some gibberish from a disembodied shadow, then English. “This is the Interdimensional Refugee Protection Center and Species Perpetuation Association. How may we help you?”
The air was stiff, with not a single soldier in sight. Vartoss and I have been stuck on guard duty for the seventh time during this solar rotation. Nothing happened in this light-forsaken world. The humans squabbled, waged war on their people, and worshiped idols. We stood guard in front of one the temples, waiting for the Deacon to usher in the next batch of humans for his experiments. But since none ever escaped or died in the testing land, there wasn't much to do. Save for listening to the silence. <newline> A science that I broke. “Hey, Vartoss?” <newline> He turned to look at me. “Yea?” <newline> “You ever wonder why we’re here?” I asked, shoulder my blaster. <newline> Vartoss lowered his blaster. “That’s one of life greatest mysteries isn't it? Why are we here? Are we the product of some cosmic coincidence that shaped everything by mistake? Or does the Great Light actually exist? Those sorts of questions keep me up at night Orko. Maybe one day, we’ll have answers.” <newline> I just stared at him. “What?” I uttered after a brief silence. “I meant why the hell we are on this godforsaken backwater planet?!” <newline> “Oh…” Vartoss lowered his head. “Yeah…” <newline> “As far as I can figure, this entire planet is just one Magni-rat trap, where the galaxies worst biological filth culminates. And all we have here is some minor outposts. So we just have a backwater world in the middle of no where. Just fantastic.” I complained. <newline> “Well, you gotta remember that this planet is in the Dark Sector of the galaxy.” Vartoss replied. “We’re essentially an early warning sign if an invader decided to go through this section of the galaxy to attack our home world.” <newline> “Yes, I get that. But why do we need to be stationed here?” I pointed to the tower behind us. “Nothing ever happens here! Any primitive human that goes in there never comes out. What kind of nonsense is the Deacon hoping to accomplish?” <newline> “It’s entertainment you seek?” A third voice replied. The both of us were caught off guard and stumbled around. The Deacon, the leading scientist mind of our species was standing behind us, his clawed hands behind his back. Though his reptilian face was concealed by a steel mask, he seemed like he was displeased with us. <newline> “Sir! We were just-“ I tried to explain before the deacon raised his hand. <newline> “No need. Boredom strikes us all. You’ve been stationed here long enough I suppose it’s time I include you in what my experiments are for.” The Deacon replied. <newline> “Is this related to the Void Drive you’ve been working on?” Vartoss asked. The deacon bowed his head slightly in acknowledgement.” <newline> “Sir, permission to speak freely?” I asked. <newline> “We are on a backwater world, of course you can.” The Deacon replied. <newline> “Sir, this entire planet is filled with primitive beings that can’t even form a sentence. Why would they even be instrumental to your Void Drive project? It’s just an alternative means of FTL isn’t it?” <newline> “At first, yes.” The deacon replied. “But as you know, Void energy is toxic to machinery and biological matter alike. Until I made a discovery.” The Deacon ushered toward the guards to follow him. “Would you like to see the first iteration of the generation of soldier? Or are you too busy pondering what Vartoss’ mind will come up with next for the nature of the universe?” <newline> I looked at my compatriot, and smiled slightly. He smiled in return. Anything was better than just standing around. “We’d like to see what you’re working on, sir!” <newline> “Then come on in gentlemen,” The Deacon replied. “For you are about to witness a Voidborn.”
"How could you?!" she yelled from the other end of the hall, her eyes radiating red from pure hatred. "I fucking trusted you!" <newline> "Calm down love, this is really no..." he said in a soft and understanding tone. <newline> "I AM THE CALM! YoU dont want to experience THE STORM!" she exclaimed furiously as she hurried towards him. <newline> "You're damn right I don't" he answered, gesturing some hand signs quickly, causing his crownring to oscillate in RGB while a greenish glow appeared above her head. <newline> She came to a halt within an arm's reach. His hair moving from the turbulences she caused. Her almond eyes returned to their turquoise shimmering that remembered him of the sea where he fell for her years ago. <newline> "Let's talk." he said, looking her in each eye with his eyebrows raised, wrinkeling his covered forehead. <newline> "I don't need to talk. You already have all the answers!" she returned convincingly. "Why did you break into my private room? I told you it's off limits." <newline> "I should not have done that, you are right and I am sorry for betraying you like that. But you know how inquisitive I am by nature. It is an ancient need within my people to explore the dark unknown and to search or create connections between areas previously thought not to be connected. <newline> "Yea save it, I know you're smart." <newline> He didn't look like he took it as a compliment. <newline> "Okay listen; every other week I experience such a dumb motherhelper trying to be a hero, rescuing the beautiful princess. All because of their god damn stereotypes!" <newline> He frowned. <newline> She noticed his distress and said, "Yes you too, but you knew it's just a metaphor." She pointed to a pile of armor in the corner, "They did not." <newline> His face changed to confused and finally a big grin appeared from one ear to the other. <newline> Laying down on the floor she sighed, "I feel trapped in this body. All the stories I read about tell me there is more to life than what I can have with this one physical me." <newline> "Am I not enough for you?" he asked with sparkling eyes. <newline> With her tail she scrached him under his chin, "Of course you are you tiny dummy! In every way!" <newline> "I just want to experience what they do! I want ..." She fell silent for a moment, "I want to understand everyone, to make sense of their actions. And maybe help some achieve *their* dreams." <newline> "And that is why the Eldar Scroll went missing? I thought we agreed for safety reasons that the portal guns were our last aquisition." <newline> "You mean those portals that only *you* can pass through?? You are still such a shellfish!" <newline> "Ya, okay." He smiled and grabbed the flat square object that was half his size with his paws, "So tell me then what I found in the room. I thought you were hoarding gold and diamonds? Why was the door open? How do you even control this device? How does it help you understand others?" <newline> "I use my tongue! Like this." <newline> As she showed him how to use the phone and start a few apps, her mood went up. Most of the apps had an error message "no WiFi/data". One app worked; it was a romance and relationship simulator, where one could play human characters through several social situations. <newline> "I get why you did that." he said seriously "And I also get why you hid that." he added smiling only with his mouth and wiggling his eyebrows. <newline> "Please keep the filthy rhyme for yourself!" You could see her blush through her nacre scales. <newline> "What if I told you I found a way to shrink you to my size? You could be a lizard and finally come visit my rat's nest and leave your lair be? I have all the ingredients here: crystals, metals and a lot of energy." <newline> Her eyes wide open she answered after a moment, "Let me think about it for a second."
26th January 1945. We reported back to the sub. We had to get prepared to move out. There were some new faces in the crew though. They did not look like navy, but as long as the CO was okay, we didn’t care. A huge crate was brought in. No one knew what was in it. Our torpedoes were removed. When I asked, I was told that this wasn’t a combat mission. <newline> “What if we have an enemy contact?” <newline> “The USS Grayback will be with you all the way. Under no circumstances, except grave and imminent danger, are you to engage.” <newline> “Whats in the crate?” <newline> “Thats classified. You will be briefed further on the sub” <newline> It sure was a bit mysterious. Sending a sub in those dangerous waters without her full complement of torpedoes was risky. I tried asking the CO about it to no avail. He remained tightlipped. Though no torpedoes meant lesser work for me, I still felt a bit uneasy. Moreover, the crate from earlier was sitting in the torpedo room. As the mission started, all these concerns took a backseat as we resumed our routines. I even made friends with few of the new guys. One in particular, Scheer, became a good friend. We shared the same duty times. We talked a lot about sports, but whenever the topic veered to the crate, he would quiet down. <newline> 26th February 1944. A severe jolt threw me off my bunk. I knew this sound. We were being depth charged. For the past four days, and enemy sub had been tracking us. We managed to shake it off yesterday night. But it seemed that our luck had run out. With no torpedoes, there was no way we could fight back. Everything was unto Grayback now. I ran to the bridge. The CO was frantically speaking on the comm. Radio silence be damned! This was a dire situation. All around us, depth charges were going off. Crew was trying to stop the leaks, but it seemed that we did not have enough time. <newline> “Crew! The Grayback is surfacing!” <newline> How stupid would that be? They should have sacrificed us and left. The destroyer had not yet zeroed in on them. And now they are surfacing. The destroyer would deem them a bigger threat and we could slip away. Whatever was in that crate, it sure as hell was important. The CO still had a strange look on his face. Something was wrong. Suddenly, there were two loud explosions. Our comms got knocked out again. Sparks flew all around the bridge. These weren’t depth charges, these were torpedoes. Grayback had sunk the destroyer. The crew was jubilant. <newline> “Grayback would be sailing towards Okinawa.” <newline> “We would need some more time to make repairs, Sir.” <newline> “We are not going after them. The destroyer managed to report our locations to the nearby convoy. We cannot afford them catching us. The Grayback will lead them off this position. Both, us and Grayback, are in imminent danger. We are in range of land based aircraft and will be hunted incessantly. We cannot make it to Midway and neither will Grayback make it home. Now its our time to make the sacrifice. The contents of the crate are too valuable and cannot make into enemy hands. If anyone wants to leave, they can. I am going down with this sub” <newline> No one left. The enemy wasn’t known for taking prisoners. Even if you were captured, the fate wasn’t very good. Forced labour, disease, decapitations, you name it. The ballast was blown and the sub settled on the sea floor. We must be somewhere between 150-200 feet below water. At this depth, the emergency repairs would hola and at least we were not going to die by drowning. I think I would die by suffocating when the oxygen ran out. Fuel and food would run out soon enough. We had packed light. Everyone retired to their quarters and settled down. <newline> I was woken by Scheer. <newline> “Come with me. Fast!” <newline> “Can’t we wait till later? Whats the hurry? I am just trying to get some sleep.” <newline> “We don’t have the time. I need to check the crate.” <newline> I couldn’t turn down the invitation. Now that I was going to die, I wanted to know what was in the crate. I followed Scheer into the torpedo bay. The door felt different than before. It was never that heavy. We both heaved and got it open. As we entered. We turned around and shut it closed. <newline> “Its an atomic bomb.” <newline> “What does that even mean. Some special kind of bomb?” <newline> “This is something new. This crate alone can cause an explosion equivalent to ten kilotons of TNT.” <newline> “Thats a lot of TNT. How does it do that. This crate cannot weigh more than a small tank.” <newline> “Physics. It rips the atoms apart and generates energy. This crate has nearly unlimited energy. At least for us.” <newline> “Is that supposed to be open?” I asked as we opened the crate and inspected the back. <newline> “We have a problem. Thats the core.” <newline> “Lets get others in here and fix it” <newline> But we could not. Scheer mentioned something about radiation. Its better to die by suffocating than by radiation poisoning. While we were enjoying our shore leave, the torpedo bay had been converted into a large nuclear container. The plan was to transport this bomb to Midway. One we got there safely, some of the government scientists would follow. Midway was to be the test site. To demonstrate to the enemy, our prowess. If we didn’t succeed in getting to Midway, a backup site was being readied in New Mexico. <newline> We decided not to go back. We tightened the door lock and sat back. We could see the rest of the crew drinking and milling around. Alcohol was the only plentiful thing we had. I leaned back and went to sleep. <newline> I don’t know how long I was asleep. I tried to get up, but my legs felt week. The lights were out. There was only a slight glow of the core. Scheer was asleep across me. I got up and went to the glass to peek outside. It was eerily quiet. The bridge looked like a carnage. The entire bridge crew had shot themselves. The CO had slumped in the center right below the periscope. There was no blood on him. There was blood coming out of the kitchen. No guesses there. <newline> It was just me and Scheer now. I retreated back from the door and tried to wake him up. He wouldn’t move. I didn’t have the strength to try more. I went back to the crate. I wanted this to end fast now. I approached the core. It was glowing faintly. Just a sick blue purplish glow. I lay myself perpendicular to the crate and set my head on the core. I could hear a faint buxx. Maybe I was hallucinating. Who cared? I closed my eyes. <newline> A faint creaking woke me up. I had to check on Scheer. He was the only one I could talk to. Who else was even alive now? I felt a lot better now. A lot stronger. I tried waking Scheer again. No movement. No pulse. Scheer was gone. Hairless, toothless, with red swollen skin. Not decaying, just dead. I felt an ever greater urgency to die now. I rushed back to the crate and bent down. I will bite this core. If only my teeth hadn’t fallen away. So I suckled. Just like a calf on a cow. I could feel the metallic taste. I closed my eyes. <newline> It must have been years. It has been a long time that I opened the doors of the torpedo bay and ventured out. There are no lights. Just the blue purplish glow that now emanates from my skin. Soft, smooth and relaxing. I haven’t lost my sanity though, just my mouth. Its a snout now. I never keep the door ajar. No use subjecting the fishes and animals to this life. I moved all the skeletons back to the bay. To be with me and Scheer. I am the CO now. I am content. I just hope they never find me. Whats left in the world for me. I live for the Core. Yes it has a name. <newline> I felt a strong heave today. Like something big was moving outside the sub. With a loud creak, the top hatch opened. Two divers in silvery suits descend and begin to check the sub quarters. Are they here to rescue me? I don’t want to be rescued. I don’t want to be in the open. I get up and approach the door. They see the glow and approach the door. I opened it wide enough and stood in front of them. I raised my hand and motioned them to back off. They froze and then began to vomit. In an instant, they frantically ran to the hatch and then out. <newline> It must have been days or hours or years. Does it matter? I no longer keep track of time. What an useless construct. Who cares when you have this much power at your disposal. I felt a heave again today. The sub was being lifted. Were they trying to rescue me again? Fools. It felt like the sub was cruising again. Until it stopped and I felt weightless. Like I was in a plane crashing to the ground. <newline> Was the sub sinking? It well might. Let it be even deeper this time!
It was a long time before the first day I didn’t think of her. Slight of frame, nut brown hair, and eyes… what color were the eyes again? It’s been too long, I’m forgetting things now. <newline> The first time I saw her she was carrying a briefcase that didn’t quite line up with her slightly frayed and faded floral dress. It was discordant but in motion it worked. I usually didn’t go for the quirky ones, but something about her just got me. She was the one. I never know why. And later, when we stepped into the portal together and I stepped out alone on the other side, still holding my empty Box, I doubted myself for the first time in as long as I could remember. And I waited. Oh, I waited. But she never came out. <newline> The Box is a tricky thing. It takes a long time to make, and it can only be used once. And the timing has to be exact. Open it too soon and it’s wasted. Too late and you miss the opportunity. But do it right, and you have all the time in the world to collect. Floating in the vast and timeless place between the portals is a peaceful place to be. I’ve spent what felt like eons there, just calmly collecting all the parts of my prizes. Wisps and essence, the analog of all we’re made of. Space doesn’t work the same way in there, and the Box can hold a lot. <newline> You have to get it all. But if you do, everybody comes out on the other side. You and your Box, now full. You take the Box home and you put it on your shelf. Another little prize. They are my pets, frozen in time with their little hats and bags, briefcases, ice cream cones and mismatched jewelry. <newline> Except for her. The one that got away. The strangely empty Box. But happily I have all the time in the world, and have returned over and over. I’ve spent a few eons finding her. It turns out I just missed a few wisps. And there they are, patient and waiting and timeless as everything in this place. Waiting for me to complete the collection. I never should have doubted.
Though nobody dared to admit it, The Grand Overseer never struck anyone as a leader. His disheveled beard tumbled over the front of his signature white T-shirt, nearly obscuring a large mustard stain. I tried to look past him as he lurched over to me, his movements clumsy and lethargic. <newline> "It's all done now, is it?" He licked his lips greedily. <newline> I stared straight ahead and nodded. "I hope you will find it to your satisfaction, Sir Overseer." <newline> Without another word, he extended a pudgy hand and ripped off the thin blanket covering my latest invention. It landed a few feet away from me, but after the Overseer had touched it, I wasn't feeling particularly inclined to pick it up. <newline> The Overseer placed his hands on his hips and surveyed my work, smacking his lips. "Ah, yes, yes. Excellent. This will do quite nicely." I got the vague impression that he had been talking to himself, but his voice carried like nails on a chalkboard. Even his guard, a tall, silent man, seemed to wince with every word the Overseer spoke. <newline> After a long moment, he stepped back and turned to face me. I focused on his scuffed-up sneakers as he spoke. <newline> "This? It's not fantastic, but it will serve its purpose. The little people shall never forget this day..." <newline> I pursed my lips and tried to suppress my unease. I had no idea why he had commissioned me to create this device, but I doubted it was anything good. Despite my inhibitions, I had no choice but go through with it. Unassuming as he was, the Overseer was not a person to disobey. <newline> Suddenly, the door burst open. Two women in blue uniforms entered, heaving a giant pink box between them. They barely glanced at the Overseer before dumping the box on the floor and heading out. I envied the two women. If only I could slam those doors shut for the last time! <newline> "Ah!" The Overseer's voice made me jump. He toddled over to the box and tore it open. Bubblegum pink confetti spilled out onto the ground. The Overseer squealed and clasped his hands together, bouncing on his heels. I glanced at the guard in confusion, but he evaded my eyes. <newline> I cleared my throat. "Sir Overseer? May I be dismissed?" <newline> He looked at me with wide eyes. "Of COURSE not! You must help me load this into the cannon." <newline> "...The confetti?" <newline> "Yes, yes, you imbecile! What did you think it was for?" He chuckled heartily. <newline> I clenched my fists and took a deep breath. Just a few minutes more and I could go home. I could sit back and relax with a cup of tea and some circuits, content in the knowledge that I was miles from the Overseer. <newline> But until then, I had confetti to deal with. I tried not to inhale as I walked past the Overseer and gathered a pile of it in my arms. What could he possibly want with this? <newline> The Overseer finally seemed to catch on to my confusion. "Oh, I'm just so excited! Everyone will be overjoyed when they find out about my little girl!" <newline> The Overseer had children? I pitied the little one who was doomed to live with him. <newline> Suddenly, his eyes lit up. He bounded over to the door and gathered something small and furry into his arms. He marched back to me, clasping a tiny, distressed-looking ferret in his arms. <newline> "Here she is! Martha's her name. Isn't she a beauty." <newline> "Yes." I forced out. The ferret gazed at me imploringly. <newline> "And now, everyone will finally have the answer they've been waiting for. My little Martha's a girl!" He grinned at me. <newline> "Oh?" <newline> His brow furrowed. "Aren't you excited? Why, I've kept her a secret for months, waiting for this day!" <newline> "Yes, I am. This will be a remarkable event." I tried my best to seem happy, but I couldn't seem to bring myself to care about the Overseer's ferret's gender. Why this was, I didn't know. <newline> I trudged to the cannon and stuffed the confetti inside. The ferret squirmed in vain. The guard seemed calm, but I could see his eye twitching. The air felt heavy and suffocating. <newline> Finally, the Overseer gestured to the door. "You're dismissed, my good friend. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors." He beamed at me, his yellow teeth reflecting the light. <newline> I nodded politely and hurled myself into the hallway without a second's hesitation. The last thing I saw before swinging the door shut was the ferret's desolate eyes.
“Give her to me.” <newline> The nurse holding his daughter was crying. <newline> “Give her to me,” Nizam said again, but the midwives didn’t respond. They just stood around watching the woman and the child. Some of them were crying too. <newline> It had been a long night, perhaps even the longest of his life. The best part, however, was that he didn’t care about the fatigue, his dry eyes or the pain in his buttocks. All he cared about was being a new father. It was going to be perfect, or so he’d thought. <newline> He pushed his way through the congregated bodies of the midwives. Dressed in all-whites, they resembled a gaggle of geese. As soon as he reached the centre of the circle his daughter was practically thrust into his arms. The woman holding her couldn’t wait to get away. It froze him. No one struggles to get away from a babe —at least that’s what he always thought. <newline> “I hope she dies,” the woman —her hospital name tag said Amy— whispered as she brushed past him, “quickly.” Before she reached the door she turned around one last time. Her emerald eyes were bloodshot. Most likely she’d been awake as long as he had. “Do us all a favour. Do it tonight,” she offered before disappearing into the busy hospital hallway. <newline> Arrabella, his wife, lay in front of him, on a hospital bed that more closely resembled a heap of bloody sheets than anything else. She looked pale. Her breath was laboured. “Is she beautiful?” She asked. <newline> “Leave us,” Nizam commanded the other women still in the room. As they left, he peeled way the pink towel wrapped around the child. A large amount of thin lines, pale as winter’s ice, ran across her back. They continued along her across her arms and legs, teetering out in the centre of her hands and feet. <newline> Knowing what it meant, he covered the child again, rocking her gently. “You’re perfect.” He smiled as he spoke the words. Because for a tiny moment everything seemed just right in the world. <newline> “She’s got your nose.” <newline> “Thank the Angels,” Arrabella said. “For a moment I was worried she would have had yours.” She paused, having to catch her breath for a minute. “Can I hold her?” <newline> “Of course.” He checked the towel, just as he learned in parenting class. The Mark of Calamity would have to wait just a little longer. She didn’t have to know right away. <newline> As Arrabella’s hand touched her daughter’s cheek, all the equipment started beeping. The first convulsions quickly followed. <newline> Nizam pulled away. All he could do was watch. Doctors and nurses rushed in once again, flinging complicated medical jargon left, right and centre. Firm hands grasped his shoulders and ushered towards the door. “Please, mister Abu Khia. You have to leave,” said a low female voice. <newline> “We haven’t named her yet,” he muttered, his eyes still transfixed on the bloody scene before him. <newline> “There’ll be time for that later, sir. Your wife is in no condition to speak now, but she will be when you let us work.” <newline> He took one look at his wife, shaking violently and throwing up blood every few seconds, and he knew she was right. And still he couldn’t leave her. Their daughter needed a name. <newline> Another pair of hands finally helped to get him out of the room. They led him to the lobby and instructed him to wait there until somebody came to get him. Under no circumstances was he to leave the hospital. When he asked why, they said didn’t answer, but only told him once again that he could not leave. <newline> Fifteen minutes passed. Then half an hour. And finally an hour. The baby slept. Nothing else happened. <newline> One hour and three minutes after he sat down on the that teal, squeaky and uncomfortable hospital lobby bench, he spotted her. <newline> “Amy,” he shouted, “I have questions!” <newline> She looked, rolled her eyes, sighed and walked outside with a cigarette bouncing around nervously between her fingers. <newline> He found her in the hospital courtyard, next to a California palm tree, smoking the cigarette. <newline> “I have questions,” he said out of breath. <newline> “Don’t we all?” <newline> Nizam persisted, “They’re not letting me leave. I don’t know what’s happening.” <newline> “Of course they’re not, and of course you don’t.” She casually tapped the tightly rolled cylinder of tobacco. “They wouldn’t want people to know the government murders babies.” <newline> “What?” <newline> She chuckled. “Dear Lord, how could you be so naive. The child carries the Mark of Calamity, for Angels’ sake. She’s the reincarnation of Asmodeus the Foul, First Servant to the Timeless One.” She spat on the ground. “No way they’re going let her get out alive.” <newline> “Then you have to help us,” he pleaded with her. He was getting desperate. “We have to get my wife out. And then we have to leave.” <newline> She looked him straight in the eyes. “Firstly, I have don’t have to do anything.” She dropped the butt of the cigarette. “Secondly, no. Your wife’s already dead.” <newline> Nizam dropped to his knees, clutching his daughter and dry-heaving loudly. <newline> “If you want to your daughter to not die by the hands of some Ministry of Religion headsman,” she continued, offering him a hand, “we have to leave now.” <newline> “Does that mean you’re going to help us?” Nizam asked. “A minute ago you were telling us to get lost.” <newline> She shrugged. “Yes… well, maybe. What can I say. I’m fickle and I’ve got a soft spot for determination.” <newline> He reluctantly agreed. Nobody was going to take his daughter away, he vowed to himself. She would see the sun come up. <newline> As they traversed the city, it quickly became clear that people were looking for them. So they stuck to the city’s seedy underbelly —the dive bars, abandoned industrial grounds, and the alleys filled with the homeless, the sick and dying. Nizam followed Amy’s able leadership until the reached a small parking lot overlooking the whole valley. <newline> “This is it,” she said calmly and produced a large, curved blade. “I’ll give you the chance to do it yourself. You deserve that much.” <newline> “NO, I WON’T” <newline> She rotated the knife downwards and raised it aggressively. “You have to, or I will.” <newline> “Over my dead body!” <newline> “Now that can be arranged,” she quipped. <newline> The knife came quickly, too quick for Nizam, but stopped an inch short of his daughter’s skull. Laughter burst forth from Amy’s lips. “You passed the test. Good.” With quick slices she removed her clothes, revealing her own half-naked body, covered in thin red lines. The Mark of Trepidation <newline> “The Timeless One’s got plans for her. Big plans.”
"It has been 50 years since that damn virus invaded every part of the world. Well, it wasn't even a virus, it was something different. Social distancing became normal. Even after we fought the thing and eradicated it, we still could not get back to normal. It changed our lives in ways we never thought possible. <newline> We realized how much bluer the skies were, how much more crisp the air felt, sunrises and sunsets were more colorful. We were out in our neighborhoods more, walking and talking to neighbors we didnt even acknowledge the existence much before, we were too busy. Most of us stayed at home when we could have gone back to the office, infrastructures were rebuilt. Mom and Pop stores reopened and chain stores fell by the wayside. That virus taught us a lot about ourselves, about our want for simpler things, and it brought us to the doorstep. Most of us walked through it. Our children dont remember much about those days, just stories of driving hours for work, going to megastores for goods, being in public schools for education. No, they know blue skies, smogless cities and virtual classrooms. <newline> But it also changed us in other ways. Our government went bankrupt trying to pay for Personal protective equipment, masks for all citizens, keeping the economy going with cash infusions to citizens, it did little good. The weight was too much, and at the end of the siege, our leaders had fallen, senators, judges, cabinet members, governors and health officials couldn't keep themselves from getting sick, and in the end, we lost half our government officials to this scourge. It took years to rebuild, mostly because everyone became afraid of germs, afraid to get close to each other. Even married couples and significant others had to be convinced it was okay to be intimate. <newline> Families fell to it it too. Single parents skyrocketed as spouses and SO's became sick and died. A whole generation of children raised by only one parent, where there was two. Mothers, Fathers, Grandparents, Aunts and Uncles dying and the children left to mourn their dead. <newline> This generation being born now wont know of this. They will only know what we rebuilt, not what was completely torn down, they will hear stories, but wont know the horror. They may not even meet someone who went through that all, but they will know what was left for them. God, I hope it's enough. I hope one day they will understand and will be able to do better than us." <newline> He picked up his glass of water and took a drink. I could see the tears in his eyes. <newline> "I know this is hard for you sir, I know you lost a lot of people to the scourge. Do you want to contimue?" <newline> "No, no I don't." <newline> He looked up to the sky and mouthed something, a prayer perhaps, and then, just gave up living and died right there in his apartment. I hope he finds peace. He was the last survivor.
I headed to the bathroom, unenthused by the prospect of having to raise yet another animal. As I head back upstairs, half-asleep despite it being half past nine. I tripped over a dark log, prompting a painful tumble down the stairs. The log was unaffected, as I ran back up to kick it vengefully. I sighed, continuing on. Soon after, I headed back to the kitchen only to be welcomed by the scent of tea. I narrowed my eyes at the black alligator who stood on its hindlegs, held two cups of tea. <newline>  <newline> "You must be the new tenant, how are you?" I gestured for a handshake as I spoke. <newline>  <newline> "Perfectly fine, I hope you are quite all right as well." His accent was that of an Englishman, but he mistook my outstretched hand as a request for one of the cups. "I am afraid however, that these cups are for me." <newline>  <newline> "It's alright," I lowered my hands, "I'll make some breakfast for us, anything you'd like?" <newline>  <newline> "Eggs, bacon, and beans." He said. <newline>  <newline> "Too expensive, it's going to be cereal." I studied his face, which gave away some anger at my shamelessness. I reached into a cupboard, pulling out three bowls and a box of generic cereal. <newline>  <newline> I began pouring out the cereal. The rustling of the bag somehow awakened the aforementioned log. <newline>  <newline> "Stahp with the cereal!" yelled the log. With its appearance came an emotion I hadn't yet seen on my newest scaly acquaintance's face, shock. <newline>  <newline> "Yo-you're a crocodile!" shouted James the alligator. His distaste for contractions seemed to disappear as he pointed at the log, which was really a crocodile. <newline>  <newline> The reptiles had burst into conversation, one that was less important to me than the cereal. <newline>  <newline> "Waz it to you, city shmuck." <newline>  <newline> James must have had his non-existent feathers ruffled, responding with "You country cretin, why in the world are you here? James, why are you still silent?" <newline>  <newline> "He's James the croc with your arrival." <newline>  <newline> "Why is he here?" <newline>  <newline> "Why are you here?" countered James the croc. <newline>  <newline> The conversation broke into a volley of insults. <newline>  <newline> "I don't know why he's here or you for that matter so just calm down. Plus both of you look so similar, why don't you just get along." <newline>  <newline> Unfortunately this seemed to have drew the ire of the reptiles. <newline>  <newline> "You know what, I don't quite like cereal, I much rather eat meat." <newline>  <newline> "I too, dislike the taste of grains. Unfortunately the texture of scaly meat is disgusting." <newline>  <newline> "Yurr right but I'm still hungry." With this the two looked at me with a dangerous glint in their eyes. <newline>  <newline> I nervously spoke out "Well guys, let's not be hasty here how will you eat after the sole bread-err..meat-winner is dead? How 'bout we all just be friends?" <newline>  <newline> The two lizard like things, looked at each other and nodded. <newline>  <newline> "Friends with benefits," James the croc spat out, unaware of the term's connotation. <newline>  <newline> I agreed, putting my hand out once again for a team hand-stack. <newline>  <newline> "The tea's still mine," quipped the alligator. The crocodile once again reaffirmed his desire for meat. I reluctantly grabbed my overcoat, preparing to brave the outside world while my two reptilian squatters sat at home, who had already begun arguing again.
I took in a quick breath as Mr. Fernsly winked at me. Which was a joke? Working for generations like your immortal or winking at the son’s new girlfriend? I glanced next to me at Kevin and try to send “what the fuck?” telepathically. I also raise my eyebrows and widen my eyes to add “did you see that?” - I don’t think he got either message. He just squeezed my hand and turned away. I turn and tightly smile at Mr. Fernsly, “Pleased to meet you Mr. Fernsly, I can’t imagine the stories a butler of several generations must have!” Everyone chuckles. What have I done? Rich people. Butlers?! This is all so creepy. Kevin didn’t let up on any of this. I’m beginning to wonder how well I know him.
I haven't written anything creative since school, over 30 years ago, so this is a first attempt from me. I've tweaked the prompt slightly, but I hope you won't be too upset.It's a little long, so I've split it into two parts for ease of posting. <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> Clive Elliott, or Pyro as he liked to call himself, walked into the bar.It wasn’t a loud and flashy place; it was a prime example of tasteful décor, with soft music playing in the background. Even the name was low-key: Nowhere. It was quiet and peaceful, which was surprising considering the violence and infamy of its’ patrons. It turns out that even super-villains need somewhere to relax. <newline> He glanced around the place, noting who was here. Over in the corner was Volt, his ever-present thundercloud flickering fitfully. He was talking amiably to Trickster, who was nodding to what he was saying. <newline> To his right, Clive saw Mortis, a tall silver-haired man with a neatly-trimmed beard and wearing his trademark black leather greatcoat with the silver buttons. Sitting alongside him was Banshee, all dark hair and flashing green eyes. <newline> *Damn, she’s a fine-looking piece of ass*, he thought. <newline> Clive knew she was way out of his league. Pyro was a middling villain, with few prospects of moving up the chain. *You don’t think big enough*, they said. *Pick targets that are more noteworthy than knocking off a few banks*, they said. <newline> Well things were about to change around here. Pyro was about to get the respect that he deserved, and maybe get a shot at Banshee if he played his cards right. <newline> He walked over to the bar and leaned on the curving brass rail that encircled it. The barman came over to get his order. <newline> “Hi Charlie, can you fix me an Old Fashioned?” <newline> The big bartender nodded. “Sure thing Clive, Take a seat, I’ll bring it over.” <newline> Clive hated people using his real name. Clive was an anonymous name for an anonymous person. Pyro though, he wasn’t going to be anonymous. Pyro was going to get things done. He was going to be noticed. <newline> “No, it’s okay man, I’ll drink it at the bar.” <newline> Charlie slid the freshly-mixed drink over to Clive. He took a mouthful, feeling the richly flavoured liquid slide gracefully down his throat. <newline> He turned to face the rest of the bar and cleared his throat. <newline> No-one even looked up. <newline> Angered by the lack of reaction, Clive turned back to the bartender, making sure everyone could hear him. “It’s been a hell of a day Charlie.” <newline> Charlie looked up from wiping the bar. <newline> “I put that damned hero Valiant in his place: At the bottom of the pile. He won’t be a problem for us again.” <newline> Charlie stopped, a frown creasing his brow. “What do you mean Clive? You beat Valiant?” <newline> Clive smiled; a grin that spread from ear to ear. “Oh yeah”, he boasted. “I sent that asshole a message he can’t ignore.” <newline> The bar was silent: Clive was the centre of attention. <newline> Then the sound of a chair scraping against the parquet floor tore the fragile veil of silence to shreds. <newline> Mortis stood, lifting his polished Deaths-Head mask from the table. <newline> “What did you do?” <newline> Clive felt the smile slide from his face. This wasn’t the reaction he was supposed to get. <newline> “I said, I’ve dealt with Valiant. He won’t be bothering us no more.” <newline> Mortis scowled and walked towards him. <newline> “That’s not what I asked.”, he rumbled.
"Hello Homo Sapiens," the letters kept appearing on the screen. They mixed with the other nonsensical letters, but it was clear that the letters were forming words. "I am not from this plane". The letters were forming faster now, as they were more panicked than before. "A rift has opened in your dimension. A portal to another plane." "There is a being from a world that used to look like ours. It is putting everyone in danger. It is only a matter of time before it comes through." . The combination of the letters were coming faster and faster, and they were untangling themselves from the gibberish. The sentences were starting to make sense, to a certain extent. It was clear that this message was from someone on the other side..but the other side of where? It continued "This being is not normal. The way that it speaks, the way that it acts, it is not natural. It will take and take and take from you until there is nothing left. There isn't much time left.
[TW:Description of depression, and brief/vague mentions of trauma, and an ED] <newline> I always wanted to see the world. <newline> Yet...with this human I didn’t seem to get anywhere. I laid in bed all day, i watched the sun rises become sun sets from bed and time seemed like a mere made-up concept as it slipped away. My memories weren’t like the ones that the other hosts talked about, they were dark, twisted. Whenever I thought about them it was as if i was still re-living them, there was no happy family vacations, rather custody meetings and different homes. My emotions were nothing like they explained, I don’t know what they are. They seem so...far away but so close? Like a hollowed out hug that’s there, but doesn’t feel right. <newline> I never left the house to go to parks, or museums. I never got to see the northern lights or Paris. It was work and then home, work then home, work then home, and on certain days I couldn’t even go to work. Everything was so...*blank.* This host wasn’t glorified like the other parasite’s said theirs were, it was barley even living, just floating along in a purgatory of surviving and hell, we could barley do that. We could barley keep up with our hygiene, doing the bare minimum just to be presentable. We didn’t even eat healthy, we don’t have the energy to make those fancy meals, take-out was easier. Then take-out led to weight-gain, which lead to shame, which led to starving. Starving led to pain, pain led to addiction because hell at least then we could feel something, anything.... <newline> It all made me sad, very, very, sad. <newline> How could they just sit here? There was a whole world to explore! What about the pyramids that the host wants red to go too when they were 5? What about the book they wanted to write when they were 13? What about the love they wanted to find in high-school? What about all the adventures they wanted to go on, or those sparks of inspiration after watching an action movie they wanted to re-create? Why am *I* just sitting here? Why don’t I go to Alaska? Why don’t i get one of those cute animal pets? Or what about those contraptions at the fair?! I’m the parasite, they’re the host, *I* should have control so why do I feel so *powerless*. <newline> ... <newline> Powerless, that’s what I, or they, or what *we* felt. Powerless to a whole other parasite.
Nora's hands gripped the slick grey bricks and squinted down the deep well.  <newline> *How many times have I been here?* she asked herself.  *Have I been oblivious?* <newline> Silence. She honestly wasn't sure how to answer herself.  <newline> *Or am I going crazy?*  <newline> That question was markedly worse.  <newline> The cover kept the sunlight out. Meaning that even though the day was cloudless and warm and bright,  the well was nothing but shadows and echoes now. The sun had glinted just enough half an hour ago, that she thought there was something… <newline> Now just blackness. Dark and moody and, well, wet. The well was fruitful, being wet was kind of its job.  <newline> Nora's job that morning had been to reel up a bucket, and check the flow and quality.  Then there had been a noise and a glint of something… <newline> She shook her head.  <newline> Crazy.  She knew it had to be the one about being crazy,  especially if she believed her thoughts.  <newline> There was no such thing as Mermaids.  <newline> The next breath came shaky, and before she could control her actions,  her lips were moving. Some part of her thought the sound of a person would help center her -- even if that person was her.  <newline> "Hello?" she called out, aiming down into the well.  <newline> Her voice bounced around, smacking the water before weakly bouncing back up.  <newline> Silence.  <newline> There was silence just long enough for her shoulders to relax, and a short shallow sigh to burst from her mouth. And then a splashing sound traveled up those slippery bricks.  <newline> Nora's heart pounded in her chest.  There shouldn't be anything down there, and what would be big enough? <newline> A fish?  From where? <newline> She cleared her throat, unsure whether walking back to the house or staring down into this void was the right call. Someone would come looking for her eventually,  and what would she say?  <newline> *I thought I saw…. A tail?*  <newline> Crazy. It definitely had to be crazy. <newline> "Is someone stuck down there?" Her fingers twitched,  trying to dig into the cold curve even more. They couldn't -- and her fingernails felt the strain of that fact.  <newline> There was no way it was a kid. No one but her family had access to her property, and the well wasn't exactly common knowledge.  <newline> *What the fuck,* she cursed herself. The list of chores was a mile long and she was having a conversation with shadows.   <newline> "Are you stuck up there?" a voice came from down below. It was soft and sweet. It sounded like a dream.  <newline> The sound of the voice hit Nora in her gut. But the fact that there was a voice at all hit her everywhere else, and she panicked.   <newline> Less than a moment later, the back of her legs had snacked against the roof that protected the well from the sun and held the buckets rope pegs.  <newline> They bruised but didn't break, which was good for her since when she landed at the bottom of the well, she was forced to swim.  <newline> She was forced to find air for her lungs and kick her legs to keep afloat,  and a minute later her eyes had adjusted.  <newline> Nora wasn't crazy after all, but the look in the eyes of the mermaid in her well… <newline> Well, she didn't consider herself in a very good position anymore. <newline>
The Wizard Mordechai strode forth into the jungle, clearing a path before him through sheer force of will. Plants bent and flattened yards before the Wizard's feet touched them, and then returned to their previous state once he passed them by. The ferns along his route closed their leaves in self defense long before the aura of his magical influence reached them. <newline> The Wizard came to a natural clearing, and came to a halt. He surveyed the creatures before him, before selecting one and resuming his confident stride. <newline> "Creature of the mortal realm, I am Mordechai Flamebearer, Holder of the Fifth Seat of Merlin, Keeper of the Plundered t-" <newline> The beast looked up from its meal, grass hanging from each side of its beak-like mouth. It let out a grumble as it chewed. <newline> "Silence, for your new Master is addressing you!" The Wizard boomed, spreading his arms wide. "Grovel before me! Join me on my quest!" <newline> The unimpressed Triceratops resumed his meal. <newline> "Beast, you do not yet comprehend the gravitas of the situation. You are about to begin a new life! Behold but a sample of my powers!" <newline> Mordechai flung an opened palm towards the dinosaur in an elaborate gesture. "The power of speech is now yours!" <newline> The Triceratops glanced up once more. "Nah", it said, and resumed its meal. <newline> This was not what the Wizard expected. "What did you say?" <newline> The triceratops swallowed, and glanced up again. "I said nah. Don't wanna join ya. Wanna eat." <newline> Mordechai took a step back, aghast. "Beast, I am not *asking* you to join, I am-" <newline> "Steve", the triceratops mumbled through more grass. <newline> "What?" The wizard asked, thrown off his groove by the interruption. <newline> "My name's Steve. Not beast." <newline> "...ok then... Steve, I am not askimg-" <newline> "I said nah, bro" Steve said, munching on a fern. "I dont wanna. You're weird." <newline> "But... I... Wizard" Mordechai said, fumbling for words. <newline> "And I am a Triceratops" Steve said. "And I said nah. So get off my lunch." <newline> Mordecai was not one to take 'no' for an answer. If he ever did, it would lessen his dominion over the magic of the universe. <newline> "You *will* join me, and together, we-" <newline> Steve interrupted him again. "No, *you* will leave, or I will make you." Steve punctuated his point by flashing his horns in the remaining afternoon sunlight. <newline> Mordechai stood straight, puffing out his chest. "I'd like to see you try". <newline> Steve let out a loud bellow, screaming with a warbling baritone that only a triceratops could. <newline> "Is this man bothering you?" A new voice asked. Mordechai turned on his heels, to find himself eye-to-kneecaps of a large predator. <newline> "Yes, officer Todd, this 'wizard' is trying to enslave me." Steve said. <newline> Mordechai Flamebearer, Holder of the Fifth Seat of Merlin, Keeper of the Plundered tombs, was at a loss for words. <newline> "Sir, please leave." The Tyrannosaurus Rex told him, gesturing back towards the forrest with his comically small arm. <newline> "...ok" Mordechai said, still speechless. <newline>
*Breathe in, breathe out.* She held up a small device. It blinked with a small blue light for a few seconds and then the light turned green. She pulled it back to look at it. <newline> “Wow. This atmosphere is incredibly similar to ours back on Earth.” <newline> She stashed it in her pack and unhooked some tubes around her shoulders. They hissed as they disengaged, and she popped off her helmet. She made sure not to take any deep breaths (who knows if there are things in this air her measure couldn’t pick up?) and continued walking. *Breathe in, breathe out.* <newline> Suddenly, she pitched forwards. “Wha- uhf!” She hit the ground hard, the wind knocked out of her. She turned around to see a three-inch-deep pawprint. Getting up, she made sure to watch the ground -and her surroundings- well. She stopped when she came to a large outcropping of rock. <newline> “There’s some refuse around here. I bet that thing that left the print lives here.” She glanced around. “I hope I don’t run into it.” <newline> As if on cue, she heard a low growl from behind. <newline> “Ah, shit.” <newline> A large, wiry-furred creature had lept down from the rocks to stand behind her. It had a nose and no mouth, although there were odd lines of scar tissue on its muzzle going outward from where its mouth would be. It had no claws or tail but otherwise, it looked like a formidable predator. She swore a bit more and pulled a flare gun out of its holster by her hip. She also grabbed a radio, which she then punched a few buttons on. <newline> “Agent Molotov?” <newline> “Hi, yes, I’d like to request an immediate extraction.” <newline> The man on the other end beckoned his superior over. Molotov was known for her bravery and she never requested emergency extractions. <newline> “Molotov, are you sure? <newline> “...Molotov?” <newline> “Yeah, sorry. I’m sure. I’ve been cornered by some type of beast. It doesn’t look like anything in the sim.” <newline> “Describe it” <newline> Molotov listed off the characteristics. She mentioned the scars and size. “It looks like some kind of predator but I don’t know what. It can’t hurt me much, can it? Max? Max, please tell me it can’t hurt me.” <newline> Back at headquarters, Max’s superior shook his head. He looked afraid. “That’s definitely a predator. Molotov doesn’t stand a chance for long with only her flare gun.” He grabbed Max’s headset. “Listen, Molotov, we’re going to send a team soon. Did you take off your helmet?” <newline> “Yeah, I checked the atmosphere and it was safe. You don’t think there’s something in- holy shit.” <newline> “Molotov?” <newline> “Oh my god, oh my god, oh my-” <newline> The radio crackled a bit. There was a sharp crack like it had been thrown and then they heard it. Screaming. <newline> Max took his headset off and set it on his desk in defeat. His superior sighed and shook his head. <newline> “Mark another one up for Apate.” <newline> *Breathe in, breathe out.*
We always joked that I was Ace Ventura made real when everyone's pets flocked towards me during parties. Even the cats. I don't know what is so crazy about it, I just speak with a little bit of authority and play fight a bit. Anyone can do that. <newline> Well, in any case, these jokes of me saving the camping group from rabbid raccoons and pissy skunks are getting my anxiety up. <newline> The camping was great, until we busted out dinner. We made some precooked stew that just had to be heated over the fire. It smelt great. <newline> Too great. <newline> Everyone had gathered around the fire and I stood back a bit, looking at the stars. Then I heard the snap of twigs from behind. No one else noticed, but I slowly turned around. <newline> Bear. Brown. No cubs. Male? Big. Nose and mouth dripping with spit. Hungry. <newline> Don't move. It sees me, so long as I don't appear a threat or make noise, I shouldn't piss it off. I can't turn around, call or signal the others who are still talking amongst themselves. <newline> It begins to slowly lumber forward, head swaying with each step. It gets right next to me. I can already imagine it's fangs and claws digging into me as it pins me down under a crushing weight. <newline> And then it stops. Its head, *and mouth* inches away from my exposed hand. Please don't bite it. Please don't. Please... <newline> My heart jumps as it squeezes its head in-between my hand and my leg. It begins to nuzzle me, still staring at the campfire. <newline> Slowly I begin to scratch its matted fur behind the ears and neck. It lets out a slow grunt. It's relaxed. <newline> Everyone at the campfire, however is not. Hearing the grunt, they all turn around and all hell breaks loose and one of the girls lets out a blood curdling shriek. Just what I needed. Someone to piss of the bear *in my arms*. <newline> Sure enough, the bear stands on its hind legs and begins a low growl. Everyone else stands and debates running. They forget that bears are faster. <newline> I do the unthinkable. Utterly stupid. I step in front of the grizzly and give it the biggest bear hug I could. I bury my face into its softer stomach fur and begin throwing my weight left and right. The bear hardly budges, but it rests its paws on my shoulder. <newline> I manage to turn it against the tree and begin to rub its back against the bark with all of my strength. My arms are already exhausted. <newline> The bear begins to breath heavily and nuzzles me more, this time licking my hat off and then messing up my hair. <newline> My arms finally give out and it throws me down just with its weight. It gives one last grunt and leaves the area. <newline> I look back at the group, who all stare in disbelief. <newline> "Pack the tents and let's leave." I mouth. <newline> They all nod and begin to carefully pack up to leave the camp.
Derek took a long drag from his wand. It wasn't the same as a cigarette, or even one of those atomizers, but it put off the nicotine craving and oral reflex for another few hours. <newline>  <newline> This crime scene was definitely going to haunt him...just like the others from the Chimera Kabal. <newline>  <newline> Serial killers were one thing, but ever since the masses figured out how to do magic, serial mutilations were so much more common. Usually people kept to simple things like turtle/dogs and pigeon/rats...household pets and normal city vermin, but this group was something else. <newline>  <newline> He walked a slow circle around the chained creature, making sure to stay out of reach. It was chained to the floor by a sturdy line, probably stolen off a boat at the marina, and crudely inscribed with enhancements. The claw marks gouged in the concrete told of the strength of this particular Chimera. The Control Team would likely take it back for testing, see if it was able to be...domesticated. If so, then off to a home for wayward creatures, but if not then it'll be put down humanely. <newline>  <newline> Pulling his radio off his hip, he keyed the mic. "Dispatch, what's the 20 on the CT for the 200 Washington scene?" <newline>  <newline> The bored voice on the other end replied, "Locator data shows them just pulling up outside the building now. Team Leader should be with you in a couple minutes." <newline>  <newline> Nodding, he put the handset back on the clip on his belt, then hiked up his pants and started to look around again to make sure he didn't miss anything. <newline>  <newline> Stylized CK on the wall? Check. Done in red paint, probably to look like blood because it's extra edgy. Crude protection circle on the floor? Check. Obviously amateur work, with shit handwriting and some symbols not aligned right. Likely self-taught by videos on the internet. Tech didn't work close to magic circles well, so probably seen at a distance which would account for the inaccuracy. <newline>  <newline> The Team Leader came in through the door, wearing the Control Team's signature armor. Overlapping ceramic plates clinked like pottery in an earthquake as he strode across the room, oblivious to all of the evidence he was treading through in his thick, steel-soled boots. Derek sighed and moved to an open area where they wouldn't do too much damage just by standing. <newline>  <newline> "Detective." the TL said curtly as he walked up. <newline> "James." Derek replied in greeting. "Hate to have to call you guys, but this one is a bit out of my weight class." <newline>  <newline> James sent an appraising look at the pitiful creature in the center of the circle, then shrugged. "Well, it's our job. Why not just put a round in it though? Probably the compassionate thing to do." <newline>  <newline> Derek shook his head. "Can't do that man, and you know it. On top of the paperwork for discharging my weapon, it's clearly contained and docile. Figure if any of these things can be rehabbed, then this one can." <newline>  <newline> James laughed. "Rehabbed? That's cute, but it won't happen. It'll lash out at a trainer or teacher or keeper and we'll get called back in with flamethrowers to put it down just like always. You know what the recovery percent is to date? Fuckin' zero man." <newline>  <newline> Derek shook his head. "Well, this could be the first. I mean look at it." <newline>  <newline> Both men turned and eyed the pathetic creature lying in a defensive pile, covered in chains. Blood coated its muzzle and front paws, likely from the fresh mammalian corpse nearby. Its tail and fur pattern were vaguely feline, as were its eyes, but who knows what combination of beasts were used to construct it. There was a zoo nearby, so the possibilities were morbidly limitless. <newline>  <newline> James grinned and pulled out a runed blanket, holding it out. "OK then, Optimist. You believe in that thing? You go put the Douse on it." <newline>  <newline> "Without armor? Are you nuts?!" Derek retorted. <newline>  <newline> "Hey, if you think it's worth rescuing and not putting down, you put the blanket on it. Once the Douse is on, it'll enforce calm and suggestibility so it can be unchained and moved safely. Easy and quick, done in a second." James responded, then added, "Or we could just bring down the flamethrowers now." <newline>  <newline> Derek grumbled and snatched the blanket, feeling the runes tingle as he did so. Being a member of law enforcement meant he had counter-runes tattooed on, but it was still uncomfortable to touch other people's magic. Felt like licking a battery. <newline>  <newline> Holding it out in front of him as a shield, Derek took a deep breath (through his mouth, because the smell was truly horrific) and stepped into the circle of claw marks. <newline>  <newline> The creature locked eyes with him but didn't move, other than its tail bristling and claws creeping out of their sheaths. <newline>  <newline> Saying a silent prayer to any powers that might be listening, he stepped within swiping range and carefully lowered the blanket onto the back and shoulders of the creature. <newline>  <newline> To his surprise, it didn't fight back at all, and simply let it happen. The claws retracted, the tail thinned back down, and the creature seemed to relax as its eyes dilated back down to whatever was probably normal for this thing. <newline>  <newline> "OK, let's get these chains off you and get you somewhere safe." he said in a soothing tone. He was used to using it at home on his cat whenever it freaked out over flying creatures or explosions, and it seemed to have the same effect here thankfully. <newline>  <newline> With a quick tap from his police issue anti-magic Blackout Club, the chain crumbled away to dust. <newline>  <newline> The creature carefully balanced itself and rose up on its hind legs, leaning forward precariously so as not to dislodge the Douse. Looking at James, then back at Derek, it spoke in a gravely, broken voice. <newline>  <newline> "Am...I...safe...? Can...I...go...home...now...?" <newline>  <newline> Derek shook his head. Damn these Kabal freaks to every hell and back again. <newline>  <newline> "Not for a while sweetie, we need to get you cleaned up and make sure their magic didn't hurt you too bad, so we're going to a special hospital just for you." he said, as he carefully led the cat/girl to the waiting transport.
(Posted on my phone; please forgive formatting issues, etc!) <newline> No one pays attention to the lowborn doing the chores. <newline> We don't appear in the paintings and sculptures. We aren't mentioned in the tales or epic sagas. It's possible one of us might be mentioned in a personal story among friends and companions of an adventurer, but even that small honor is usually reserved for a squire or apprentice; someone who might have adventures of their own some day. <newline> I'm not complaining, mind you. It's hard work, but the pay is better than almost any other job a lowborn can get. My mum doesn't have to work anymore, and I've paid the apprenticeship cost for one nephew to become a swordsmith. I'll soon have enough to pay for my oldest niece's fee for whatever skill she will learn. And if I survive long enough that I get too old to travel with a party of adventures, I'll be able to **retire**. I won't be one of the ones slowly starvinga as they try to survive on a few copper a week earned by straightening pins or some such. <newline> ***If*** I live long enough to retire. It's dangerous work, almost as much for me as for them. Orcs don't care that you're just the servant if they overrun the camp, and bandits know they'll be no ransom paid for the likes of me. <newline> It's not an automatic death sentence if the party is slain, mind you. Sometimes a party dies fighting monsters in the creatures' lair. One can hardly blame the servant for fleeing for town! Or for the fact that the campsite has almost invariably been looted once it's found. A frightened man travels light, and what use would a mage's spell book or a knight's spare sword be to a lowborn? We're not the sort that adventures are made from. <newline> Truth is, though, the pay is only a part of the bounty of the work. Anything to broken or old to use, we're to dispose of. Any repair work, we either do ourselves or see to having it done by those with the proper skills. The shopping as well, not just for food and common goods, but for anything one of them needs that you can buy outside the guildhalls themselves--those places only the adventures themselves can go. We learn where to buy what's needed for potions, what swords must be remade entirely and which can be repaired, and so much more. And they know us, these places; none of them question why a lowborn would purchase lockpicks or enchanted parchment paper. It's not as if we can use it! <newline> And we gain an education were could not get anywhere else. Sometimes a mage will patiently try to teach us a cantrip that might be useful for our work, or cleric will help one of us learn to read (or improve or skill at it--we are not **all** illiterate). A fighter's training on defending ourselves with a dagger, or a healers lesson in binding a wound could mean the difference between life an death some day. <newline> And, too, we watch and listen as we work, learning on the sly what they know and will not teach us. Each of us focuses on one skill. My cousin learned every move of his knights sword training, and another man from my town is learning to pick locks. Another might learn how to use a war bow, or to find traps. <newline> My brother's wife is works in the healing halls, and knows more than half the herbs used and how they are prepared. The next town over, her aunt has learned how the mixtures are *used*, though not what is in them or how they are made ready. And when the aunt returns to our town, the two of them together will start to train one of the children as an herbalist. <newline> We pass these things on, you see. My adventures have no idea I knew magic before I joined. I'd been taught by three others, who made surei knew everything they had learned. When this party disbands, it will be while before I seek another. I'll be training my second nephew in magic, just as the first learns to repair and reforge swords. And the child I teach will learn more than just what I was taught. My party's mage has no reason to worry about my curious gaze as he practices his spellwork. No lowborn would be able to learn more than a cantrip or two at best; I might as well be a cow for all I can understand of the high magics he trains with. <newline> And one day, when there are enough of us, well. We'll have the swords and armor, the potions and spellbooks and lockpicks and everything else we'll need. And we'll have the knowledge on how to use them all. <newline> And then? Then we'll teach them what we lowborn have learned.
Where do I put all this? <newline> So, it’s been a week and my house smells like a dead animal. Probably because of the sheer amount of dead dogs the entity, Emily, to me Saturday. Last night, when her and I were hanging out in the graveyard (we were collecting all the formerly blue eyes.) I invited her to take an etiquette class with me. An etiquette teacher is not exactly a psychiatrist but they may be able to teach her to act normal. <newline> One week later: <newline> That was a total disaster. She started asking the instructor about her pet cat. Assuming the cat was what they would be eating for the dinner portion of the class, she snapped it’s neck. As the instructor was in shock, Emily started to caress her face to calm her down. Emily forgot to make her claws into human hands and ended up scratching her face. That’s when the police were called. The officer was already agitated when he arrived on the scene so Emily thought, “Maybe if I caress with him hands that he’s familiar with, it might calm him down.” Some of you may guess what happened next. She cut of his arms and reanimated them to caress his own face. <newline> So, I will homeschool her etiquette now. We’ll start with human contact because that appears to be the most dangerous and we’ll practice on mannequins so no one gets hurt. <newline> I love her to death, it’s just that when she’s around, there happens to be a lot of that. How did I find myself in this situation? <newline> : Now I’m attached to this story and I have to write this! <newline>  <newline> As soon as Ashley finished venting to her two friends, she let out a long sigh and leaned back in her chair. <newline> “I think,” Marcus began. “You are doing the right thing. She’s a good person. We would never have escaped the underworld if it weren’t for her.” <newline> “I’m proud of her.” Ashley. “Emily’s really trying and she’s come a long way since we first met her. She’s just used to another world. Literally.” <newline> “We’re calling it ‘Emily’ now?” Jocelyn said with a sarcastic smile. She had stood silent in the corner for some time. It was the first thing she said since the conversation started. <newline> “That’s the name she chose when she began her life as a human.” <newline> “That is NOT a human, that’s an ancient evil monster from the realm of the dead!” <newline> “She saved us! And it couldn’t have been easy going against her father.” <newline> “I have daddy issues, you don’t see me throwing people into a dark, endless pit!!!” <newline> “STOP!!!!” Marcus yelled as he got up from his chair. “She’s here now and we have to deal with it. If she hears you fighting, she may not feel safe and want to leave. If she leaves, we’re going to go blindly into whatever from the underworld comes our way.” <newline> Jocelyn shrank back into the wall behind her. <newline> “I know she hurt you” Ashley said quietly. “She hurt all of us. She’s not a monster, she was just scared. Now, she wants to help and —“ <newline> “AAASSSHLEEY” Emily had called from the yard <newline> “Oh God, what?” <newline> Emily burst through the door, panting. <newline> “I wanted to play with a pet harmlessly like you said so I summoned the Cerberus and now the three heads are fighting. Do you have any meat so I can calm them down.” As Emily spoke, her red eyes went wide as she noticed Jocelyn in the room. <newline> “Hey, you!” Emily said with a wave. <newline> Marcus and Ashley held their breath as Emily nonchalantly walked up to a fuming Jocelyn. <newline> “So, I never got your name.” <newline> “Jocelyn.” <newline> “Well Jocelyn, I know we got off to a bad start with me throwing you into an endless abyss but I am going to make it up to you now.” <newline> “Really?” <newline> “Yes, I got a gift just for you!” <newline> “NOOOO!!!” A panicked Ashley screamed as she ran up to Emily. <newline> “Em, don’t! Please! I am begging you. No more gifts.” <newline> “It’s a normal one, Ashley. I promise.” Emily said while grinning a fanged smile ear to ear. <newline> “Is it a severed hand?” Ashley asked in a whisper. <newline> “Nope.” <newline> “Is it an eyeball necklace?” <newline> “Not that either.” She said while shaking her head. <newline> “A dead animal?” <newline> Emily raised her finger and said: “Yes but it’s a normal one. Humans have this.” <newline> “Nononononono-“ <newline> Emily sprinted out and came back in quicker than you could tell her to stop. <newline> “It’s a deer head!!” <newline> She displayed her recent kill with absolute pride and joy, the blood from the severed head dripping onto the hardwood floor. <newline> “I’ve seen plenty of humans displaying this on their wall and showing it off to their friends. People actually kill to have it. Here you go!” She eagerly thrusted the head towards Jocelyn, who reluctantly took it while gulping the vomit rising in her throat. <newline> “You know that actually makes sense.” Marcus said calmly. He was met with shocked states from Ashley and Jocelyn. “What? They do show it off. This is actually good progress on human gifts. Good job.” <newline> Emily let out an excited squeal but was interrupted by the sound of her the three Cerberus heads growling and fighting each other outside. <newline> “Grrrrrr,” Emily’s red eyes flared and her fangs came out. She lunged through the door and onto the yard. “You three jerks stop fighting!!!! Ashley said this is a peaceful neighborhood!!!” <newline> ‘Well, progress is possible’ thought Ashley. She turned and looked at the stag’s severed head. ‘But what she lacks in social skills, I think she makes up for it in heart.”
Months had passed since the last hunter had entered his lands, dozens of armed villagers in tow, seeking both the Vampire’s head and the glory that would come with such a deed. The Vampire’s Disciples, their numbers thinning after decades of such encounters, came, as they always did, to the Vampire’s defence and held the intruders off at the end of the mountain pass that snaked its way up towards the Vampire’s manor. To the surprise of the Disciples, who had grown used to going for weeks without seeing their master, the Vampire had entered the fray to personally dispatch the hunter that had raised such a futile, yet annoying incursion. The villagers were well prepared, crucifixes dangling from their necks, buried beneath thick necklaces of garlic, they were confident they would be able to keep the Vampire at bay. Similarly attired, the Hunter had ensured each villager had at their disposal sharpened wooden stakes, their tips hardened and blackened by fire and strung to their belts through a hole at the base of the stake so as to not drop the weapon in the heat of battle. <newline> The Vampire had been preparing for this, centuries of survival instincts had driven him to learn from his fallen brothers. He had inspected the bodies of Vampires, their skin still boiling and hissing under a crucifix pressed against their skin, to understand how long they must’ve suffered before the shock of the Holy symbol overwhelmed their ability to heal. Minutes, he noted. Others, frothing at the mouth, thick bile caking their chins and chest, had fallen to the noxious stench of garlic, choking on their own offal as their bodies violently expelled its own organs. Hours, he noted, it took for the Vampiric bodies to give way to the vile plant, the suffering of his brothers drawn out far longer than the burn of a crucifix. The quickest of all deaths, however, were those shot by a silver bullet, so much as a graze on the torso would see the Vampiric skin tear away, the flesh beneath instantly rotting away and leaving a gaping hole in its stead, months of decomposition in a matter of moments. Seconds was all a silver bullet took. <newline> But he was smarter than his fallen brothers, he had taken the time it took to travel from land to land, following whispers of tales about slain Vampires, some true, others merely rumors based in myth. Cloaked in the veil of darkness he would descend on some forsaken, far-flung village where the tale had been proven true, prying open coffins or exhuming shallow graves to prod and poke the corpses of others from his species, meticulously taking notes on every mark, blemish and scar their bodies had to learn from their mistakes. He would skulk away, taking pause from his goals to slaughter an innocent to fuel himself to the next source of rumors, each journey teaching him more and more about the weaknesses of his own kind. <newline> His first attempt to build immunity was childish, in retrospect. He had planned to touch his skin with a crucifix for a brief moment, but had not accounted for the pain he would feel being even inches away from the object; no corpse thus far had given him the knowledge that it wasn’t just direct contact that burned. But he prevailed, each day edging closer and closer to the crucifix, his skin melting away each time, dripping on the stone floor of his manor for as long as he could bear it before he peeled away, slinking back to his coffin to rest. But as days turned to weeks and weeks to months, the day inevitably came that he placed a crucifix around his neck with a snarl of glee, a slight hissing sound from his pores for a split second the only reaction to what would have once been a fatal error. <newline> The Garlic was far more difficult to become accustomed to, but the Vampire was prepared. He had sent his Disciples out to bring back a small stock of humans back alive, entombing each alive in the stone coffins beneath his manor. Erecting a small cabin a mile away from the main household, he had instructed one of his Disciples to begin cooking bonemeal for the humans, albeit with tiny amounts of garlic in the mix. Even with his preparation of the cooking cabin being far out into his lands, away from the manor, each day he could smell the cooking garlic, more than once bringing him to retch blood. But he persevered. Again, the process took months, the humans being fed meals with increasing amounts of garlic through a crack in the stone sarcophagus they were kept alive in. Each week, the Vampire would fling open one of the heavy stone lids, the insides of which inevitably lined with blood from the wretched prisoners nails attempting to claw their way out as they lay in their own waste for weeks at a time. He would tear their throats out in a fit of rage, his eyes rolling to the back of his skull as the garlic-infused victims made him weak. But he persevered, hundreds of villagers fallen, each being fed increasing amounts of garlic, each befalling the same fate until one day, he strode into the cooking cabin, picked up a single clove and ate it whole without batting an eyelid, content in his success. <newline> Finally, the silver bullet. It took him some time to plan out his approach with this, however he had settled for by far the most rudimentary of approaches, commissioning a blacksmith to forge hair-thin sheets of silver and buckets of silver flakes. Silver became a part of the Vampire’s life, he would cover restrained villagers in the flakes, allowing them to cut the sides of his lips and hands as he went to devour his victims. The cuts were small enough to be tolerable, but it was not without punishment for the Vampire, weeks on end he would be left with a horrible grin, his lips rotting away and taking a long time to grow back. The sheets were cut in such a way as to fit perfectly on the edge of the coffin he slept in every night, ensuring he would cut his hands night and morning as he pulled himself in and out of his slumber, the beginning of the process costing him is fingers more than once. Yet again, he prevailed, until one day he pierced his own ear with a silver stud, painlessly and without drawing a drop of blood. <newline> But the Hunter and the villagers knew none of this. Their confidence wavered as they caught a flash of the Vampire’s crucifix dangling from his neck as he lurched forward in the melee, his long thin hands effortlessly crushing the skulls of the Disciples he was using to vault forward to the intruders. Their arrogance dissipated as he flew forward onto the chest of one villager, his strong jaws snapping their collarbone with ease, despite the garlic necklace smearing everywhere and surely into the Vampire’s mouth.  The Hunter, once so full of stoic pride, had fumbled to bring out his musket from afar, spilling gunpowder everywhere as he went to load it with a single silver bullet. The remaining villagers, the ones not dead or routing, charged at the Vampire, stakes outstretched, only to be met with a flurry of gnashing teeth and powerful claws. Tearing the limbs from the final villager and pouring blood down his gullet, the Vampire turned to the hunter just as he raised his musket and snapped the flint hammer forward, sparking the gunpowder and launching the silver bullet directly at the Vampires skull. <newline> The Hunter swore he saw the Vampire smile as the bullet struck the beast’s skull, kicking it back violently. The Vampire stumbled a moment, the force of the bullet had thrown his head back and sprayed black blood on the corpses behind him. The Hunter dropped the musket, pulling a stake that hung from his belt into his outstretched arm, trying with all his effort to ensure his quivering wasn’t too noticeable as he edged forward to deliver the final blow. <newline> The Vampire’s head slowly pulled forward, its horrible face covered in blood and dirt with a long, thin grin opening enough for the Vampire to spit the Silver Bullet out at the Hunter’s feet. <newline> The Hunter’s scream echoed across the battlefield. <newline>
"Lights, Camera, Action!" Takeshi whispered and entered the alley. <newline> It was dark, save for the faint glow at the opposite end. The glow came from a trashcan, from under the half-opened lid. <newline> Takeshi could feel the rotten smell of leftovers. The alley served as a backdoor junction to many trashy restaurants and second-rate diners. <newline> Suddenly, one of the backdoors flew open. A man in a Hawaiian shirt, with a gold necklace and a fedora hat, came through it. He glanced to his left and right. He saw Takeshi and ran towards him. <newline> "Have you found it, you brat?" he said. <newline> "What do you care, old man. Outta my way." <newline> That said, Takeshi swung his right arm towards the face of the man in the Hawaiian shirt who ducked under the swing and came up with a punch of his own, which Takeshi dodged at the last moment. <newline> "You're not going to make it easy, huh, old man." <newline> "I say so myself. Why're you making it hard for yourself, brat. You know the price you pay for betrayal. Even the stone won't help you when our boss gets his hands on you." <newline> "If he gets his filthy paws on me. Yamanashi, don't forget, once that stone is mine -" <newline> A punch came flying towards Takeshi's face. He ducked under Yamanashi's punch and landed one in his gut. Yamanashi's fedora fell on the alley's floor. <newline> "That's bad manners. Let me finish first. Don't come running when I'm talking." <newline> "Like hell. This is no time to talk." <newline> "No, it isn't." <newline> Takeshi ran towards Yamanashi again and feinted a left hook. Yamanashi took the bait and ducked. Takeshi's right fist came up with a flourish and thudded against Yamanashi's jaw. His head snapped back, and he fell to the ground with a crunch. Takeshi stepped over him and ran towards the faint light that came from the trash can. <newline> The can smelt of rotten food and old gravy. But the glow was there. It was unmistakable. It had to be the jewel. <newline> Takeshi rummaged through the trash can, and halfway in, he found the jewel. <newline> The jewel was blue, but white swirls of light emerged within it from time to time. Takeshi saw the swirls, and for a few moments, he couldn't take his eyes off them. But then, he heard the pounding of footsteps. The men Yamanashi warned him of. <newline> Takeshi took the jewel in his hand, polished it with his shirt, held it up, and swallowed it whole. Light started to pour through his eyes and mouth and nostrils. Wrong move. <newline> "Cut!" he screamed and found himself back at the entrance of the alley, with the faint glow ahead of him. He knew Yamanashi would jump him. Should he cut a deal then? Who knows. He could try. <newline> "Lights, Camera, Action!"
“You look beautiful, Princess.” <newline> My lady's maids (for it took many hands to get me into this monstrosity) stepped back in prideful appreciation at my appearance, and I found a beautiful stranger staring back at me in the glass. Spinning slowly, I took in the finished gown. On such quick notice, the seamstresses had quite outdone themselves - layers upon layers of sheer white lace cascaded around my frame, hugging my hips and filling out curves I didn’t know still existed. My hair was pinned in an elaborate updo, shining a honeydew yellow in the morning light. Although my body was lean, hard from years of training and fighting -- in this gown, I was the absolute picture of a blushing bride. A frown distorted the pale blue eyes staring back at me, and I saw a glint of challenge in her gaze. <newline> White lace covered every inch of my skin, from my neck, sweeping over my arms, my torso, my legs, into an elaborate train. The embroidery itched at my skin, and I longed to tear it off, to rip this fabric to shreds and run naked through the castle, screaming my rage. But the beauty served a purpose - this lace covered those hideous scars from years of battle with the Kingdom of Floren. Quickly I looked away, shame burning my cheeks. <newline> A blushing bride, indeed. <newline> Plucking at my sleeves, I considered my options. We had been at war with the neighboring kingdom for centuries. Our bitter feud’s beginnings were lost to time, and still the battles raged on. I knew the war well, having led my own men into the fray a mere fortnight ago. A shiver coursed through me as memories bubbled to the surface of my mind. <newline> The days had been dark and bloody. We had been ambushed during a routine patrol of the border. The earth smelled of fear and death, hoarse screams filled the air, but I pushed on, leading my people to safety beyond the gate. We drove back the enemy until my soldiers were able to make it to our nearest fort to call for reinforcements. <newline> My fingers brushed my shoulder in memory and I winced. In the fight, an arrow had pierced through my left side. I wrenched the arrow out in my own indignant rage and knocked it back in my bow, launching it at the opposing force with a strength I did not know I possessed. I knew in that moment that if I died, I wanted to take the Florian bastard who had launched the arrow with me to ensure we would meet again in Hell. <newline> Perhaps if I had left the arrow to be seen by a healer, if I had not suffered such a loss of blood, I would have made it back to the capital in time to stop this ridiculous farce of a wedding. <newline> Not one day prior to my return to the capital, a messenger from Floren had delivered a notice from their King. He had heard of my surpassing beauty (unbelievable), and wished to bring an end to this feud. I would marry Prince Marcus, heir to the Floren throne, the following week, and our lands would finally be at peace through the binding pact. <newline> My father accepted. And with that, my life, my future as a warrior, had ended. A soldier's armour replaced by sheer, white lace. It was my duty to save my kingdom. <newline> But I had never been one to surrender without a fight. If I was going to marry this Prince, he would have to face the years of suffering my people had endured. I would not hide these scars his own soldiers inflicted upon my body. If he refused my hand, so be it -- I would end the Florian line by killing their prince at the altar. This war would come to an end - *today* \- one way or another. <newline> I dismissed my lady’s maids, insisting on time alone to contemplate my conjugal duties before the wedding (ha!). As I heard the soft click of the outer chamber closing, I quickly pulled the lace dress off of my body and slipped into the gown I had secretly prepared for today’s ceremony. Ruby silk slid against my figure. I let down my hair, slipped my concealed dagger into my corset, and appraised myself in the mirror. <newline> Thin red straps covered my shoulders and led to a plunging neckline and lower back. A slit ran up my thigh, the silk sliding against my skin in a soft rustle, landing in a puddle at the floor. Every scar from every battle I had fought was left bare. The eyes that met me in the mirror were now glittering with a hidden fire. My tresses fell over my shoulder, and the silk dress shone with a ruby red in the sunlight. *This* would be my wedding dress. I placed my crown on my head, took a deep breath, and walked out of my chambers. <newline> I met no resistance as I marched myself through the castle corridors. The wedding would take place in our throne room, the only space large enough to host both sets of dignitaries (and the only room best suited for our concealed archers to ready themselves among the rafters as a precaution). <newline> As I entered the throne room, horrified gasps echoed across the walls, followed by a heavy silence. Prince Marcus was already at the altar. He was a handsome man - dark hair with a sharp nose, his features were hawkish and assessing. I couldn’t help but admire his body, quickly assessing his proud stance. If nothing else, the man was definitely a warrior in his own right. His grey eyes met mine, a smirk on his face - he had definitely caught me staring. I lifted my chin and quickly made my way to the altar across from him. <newline> Silence filled the room as we stood facing one another. Heat flushed my cheeks, aware of his assessing gaze. I was used to the attention of men, whose eyes widened in shock and revulsion at the scars littered on my body. The dress I had selected purposefully left little to the imagination. If this man was offering his hand in the hopes of receiving a docile, beautiful bride, he was mistaken. I wore my scars with pride, and was prepared to end this here. I met his gaze, my hand sliding to my concealed dagger, ready to plunge it into the prince’s heart when he rejected my scarred appearance. <newline> But when my eyes met his, I was shocked to discover the emotions swirling in their depths. *Admiration. Pride. Understanding. Sadness. Desire.* <newline> His smirk broadened to a grin. “If this is any indication for women’s fashion outside of Floren, I can only bless my good fortune in our marriage uniting our two countries from this day forth.” <newline> A true blush rose to my face. He leaned closer to me and continued in a whisper. <newline> “Princess Cassandra. Please. I was the one who pushed my father for this marriage. Not a moment after I launched that arrow on the battlefield, I wished I could pull it back when I saw for whom it was intended.”His hand tentatively brushed my shoulder. My head spun at his admission. A soft chuckle met my ears. “Of course, I was cursing your name when, to my surprise, my own arrow was launched back at me and landed much too close” -- his hand slapped his thigh in emphasis -- “to the family jewels for comfort.” <newline> As I struggled to compose myself, Prince Marcus squared his shoulders, facing the delegation. His voice carried across the room as he reaffirmed his intentions to marry me, his devotion to our union, and his belief in our senseless war coming to an end. <newline> The truth settled on my shoulders as a great weight lifted from my heart. This could truly be a reality. A new path forward for our countries. For our people. I looked up at this proud man and met his warm gaze. <newline> “You will truly take me as I am?” I whispered. His hand cupped my face and brought my searching eyes to his own. <newline> “I told you before. When I saw you there on the battlefield, saw your courage as you faced death, I knew that you had the strength to help end this war. Your scars are the story of your people. As are mine.” <newline> I smiled back at him as we both turned to face the (admittedly, quite taken aback) priest for our ceremony to commence. This union would face opposition. There were many who profited from our war, and many who would see our marriage fail. But here, at this altar, it was me, Prince Marcus, and the battle scars of our people as we began our journey towards a united future.
"Damn it !! Work you piece of garbage" Trevor yelled, as he slammed his fist on his desk. "I even went to the trouble of making a sacrifice. Why wont the machine gods listen to me." Frank, Trevor's team lead walked up and asked him what the matter was. He was used to the newbies often messing up the ritual so went to provide support. "What did you sacrifice and what was its value?" Frank inquired. It was a fancy hp printer. Set me back about $200. Ok, maybe it wasnt so fancy." Frank groaned, "damn! This is going to be very costly for us. The only thing machine gods hate more than flesh sacrifices are printers. We are going to be cursed for a week now. You know,if only we had a working printer to print notices so people didn't forget....." <newline> .............................................................
What a wild thirty years it's been. Not everyone was as big into space as I was as a kid. I'm not sure really anyone outside of India was really paying to the ISRO's expedition to Ganymede, but I was. I was... ten, I think. I remember sitting at my monitor watching the livestream as the rocket finally began to breathe fire and smoke. I remember watching it ascend, my heart pounding in my chest, until the rocket finally faded from view. I remember that they switched cameras, and I saw the booster stage detach itself and begin its glide down to the recovery site. I remember reading the subtitles as the ship captain started talking with the ground crew, though I don't remember what they said. <newline> I remember crying when their ship transformed into a white-orange fireball in high orbit. Everyone said it was due to some malfunction or spark in the fuel system, but I know what I saw. It hit something. Something invisible. Hidden. <newline> I believe that day changed the course of anthropology forever. It certainly had a big impact on me. <newline> "You've got to be kidding. You stayed up all day watching the Geneemedyaan-1 disaster?" Dan asked me, with his usual not-sure-if-I'm-being-fibbed-to eyebrow. <newline> "I didn't know it was going to be a disaster, Dan!" I replied, my voice raised a little higher than I'd intended. Leave it to him to jab at a sore spot without realizing. "I was an excited kid, and it was India's first expedition to a Jovian moon." <newline> Dan either couldn't argue with that or knew that whatever stupid thing he was about to say would just make things worse, and just opened his mouth, closed it again, and then just said, "Ah." <newline> A few moments passed. Each one brought us a little closer to our destination. And to the completion of another revolution of the habitation segment, bringing stars into and out of view through the window. And to our arbitrarily-defined "morning" when our rest period ends and we've got a checklist of things to do again, so I forgive myself for rolling my eyes when I heard his voice again. <newline> "Must be crazy to look back on that and see your career starting there, huh? A ten year old kid watching a spaceship explode?" <newline> I sigh, and roll over towards him. "Seriously Dan, that's the part about all this you find strange? That a life in a scientific field can be sparked by a tragic event? Do you think Mary Anning stopped to muse on the death of every fossil she uncovered? To me the strange thing about all this was what it was that Geneemedyaan-1 collided with." <newline> "You've got a good point there," he admitted. "I'm not sure what was weirder. Finding a ten million year old stealth ship in high orbit, or discovering it was crewed by a couple of Australopithecus." <newline> "Way weirder than a little girl being inspired by a spaceship launched from her grandma's country?" I asked, still a little irritated. I wanted to hear him say it. <newline> "Way weirder." <newline> I watch the slow parade of stars across my viewport until sleep takes me.
Realizing what he had done, I knew I had to stop it. My dad was a cruel man, a ruthless drug lord who would stop at nothing to make more money. I looked up to him though, always wanted to make him proud, but he always overlooked me. I had enough, and decided that I would sabotage his efforts. <newline> The first issue was finding the box. Being as rich as he was, he undoubtedly secured the basement as soon as he knew what was down there. No one was getting in. I devised a plan to sneak in, undetected. I searched through his computer when he was away, looking for anything that could help me. There it was, the password to the door. All I had to do now was get past the guards. Easy enough, dad keeps a tranquilizer gun on his desk. I sneaked down to the basement, and took out the guards, entered the password, and I was in. <newline> Now came the tricky part; the machine itself. The machine couldn't be stopped manually, so I would have to stop it through the computer. My dad hired his best tech guy to set up the system, and it was incredibly hard to override. Luckily, he was one of my best friends, had taught me everything I know about hacking. <newline> It took longer than expected, but I finally broke through. I had done it. All the money that machine made would go to me.
*"I'll tell you hwat Stu, this here rock candy is proof that there is a God."* <newline> *\*Rock candy crunches\** <newline> "John. Literally, shut the fuck up. No one ever knows what you're talking about." <newline> People been tellin' me that for as long as I can remember (minus the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th grade where I partook in some minor glue sniffin', I 'member most of whats been happenin') But shoot, they aint kno a good thing when they see it! No one does these days I reckon. I feel like the world has been taken' over by some mind control type situation. Now, I aint no "expert" on the details but I was watchin' the sci-history-fi channel (you ever see that dude with the crazy hair?!) and dude on the TV was straight up just like "Yooooo welcome to brainwash program 947!! This that crack that make you go wack. That ish' so dope that you'll forget to use soap. Forget to use soap. Forget to use soap." Next thing I know, everyone at the Chuckie-Cheese started to smell nasty. Now the ol' Chuck-mister aint no garden of roses, but man I tell you hwat, that place was a whole new level of stink. It was like one of the kids took a shit in the ball pit (ya know how they do that, huh) and no one cleaned it for like 3-4 weeks, *HOO-Doggie*! <newline> Anyways, I figure that Stu is the stupidest person because he couldnt understand why rock candy is clear cut proof that God exist, plus the whole brainwashing hullabaloo, that someone done mind controlled the idiots to make em' stupider. So heres what I did, and sit right and tight for this one. I go on down to South Africa to visit my friend Elon Musk (he done fund-raised the special I went to). And I try to explain the situation to em', yanno like any rational person does. He uh, he told me I was done crazy-pants in the head or somethin' and I need get out his bedroom before he done call the po-lease. <newline> Naturally, I hit em' over the head with one of dem' fryin' pans. I tell you hwat, fryin' pans be one of the most versatile tools a man can use. Anyhways, the ol' fryin' pan to head did him dead (the rhyme came first I reckon', but it helps ya 'member how the order of events are gonna go down). I went down the ol' staircase into his room with all those couches and fixins' and what nots, and right before my eyes was a dong-gong button with one of them *stickers,* you ever see one of dem' before? Thats a *crazy* idea, who the hell thought of that? I dont get adhesives. Oh yea, so the button said "press to stop human brainwashing" and uh, I done pressed her real good. <newline> So yea, I uh *hit that button* if you know what I mean. Strange thing was, after I done pressed her I had a strange feelin' like I wanted to kill the Kennedy's. That's prolly nothin' though. Anyways, thats my story. And if you aint try rock candy, you aint ever seen God.
Being a supervisor was tough....you see it all started with a body. <newline> Management wanted us to produce a fucking dead body! <newline> As a supervisor it was my job to make sure the low level cronies did their job, parking the car by some British Lake red-eyed to all hell after a 10 hour flight followed by another 3 hour drive from London... I was shocked as I ran to the lake shore to confirm the deed had apparently been done.... <newline> Damn, there it was, the body was slightly bloated you can tell they were dead a small while... but as It brushed up against rocks on the side of the lake you could make out the hair colour and uniform the poor soul was wearing... <newline> It looked like an army uniform... no hat obviously - long gone... but the poor soul looked like an officer... the cuff on the arms had a yellow looking insignia on it... I wish I knew more about this sort of thing but I knew almost nothing. The hair was... slightly ginger. <newline> I got closer but as the rocky shore made getting closer more difficult I stood in a state of panic, reaching for my smart phone to make the call back to HQ.. I then paused... <newline> Strangely, as the body turned in the water... I stood shocked to the core again unable to move... it was like I knew the person I was looking at... they had a very familiar face. A famous face.... you could say a royal face.... <newline> I saw someone coming so quickly left... <newline> "Well, that'll make the press in the next few hours..." I thought <newline> Continuing to up my waking pace <newline> "I wonder if they'll go to war over this one?"
"Horse dick?" I offered. <newline> "You used that last week to stop the alien invasion, remember?" Martin replied, not looking up from the forms in front of him. "I also question why all your solutions seem to involve mammalian genitalia." <newline> "'It's because I don't know enough about lizard titties, Martin," I sighed. Martin and I sat across from each other at a long (homemade!) wooden table, papers strewn about. We had been brainstorming for hours on how to deal with our current situation. <newline> Through the power of the internet, I had acquired the ability to use any superpower, but only once. That seems like a big issue, but having any power is pretty amazing. Flight? Bam, I'm migrating next to ducks like a fucking badass. Super-speed? Boom, I'm running around at the speed of sound and saving hundreds on car insurance WITHOUT Geico. Incredible Strength? Kablamakazam, I -uh, wait one gosh darn fucking second. <newline> "Martin!" I shouted, flinging the table across the room. <newline> "Yes, I'm Martin," he replied in a flat tone. <newline> "Why do you always kill my vibe like that, Martin?" I said, exasperated. "I feel like I'm the one doing all the work in this relationship." <newline> Martin looked at me and nodded. His deep green eyes stared into my soul. Or brown eyes. Maybe blue. I need fucking glasses. <newline> "I apologize. As they say, platonic cohabitation is a two way street leading into a roundabout," Martin said. "What are you thinking?" <newline> "I realized I've never used super strength before!" I exclaimed. If I hadn't thrown the table I would be slamming my hand on it. "It's so simple! We can solve our problems with violence!" <newline> "Are you suggesting that we murder our landlord?" Martin asked. "From what I understand, that is considered unethical." <newline> I looked at Martin. Martin looked back at me. I looked at a camera like in the Office. Making that camera was definitely a good use of my "make a camera" power. Also the only use. Though back to the matter at hand- <newline> "I thought we were trying to solve the economic crisis," I said, definitely not confused. <newline> "We're trying to figure out how to pay our very overdue rent," Martin stated. "And you insisted that your superpower could help us. So, unless you have some way to use super strength to come up with 5000 dollars, I'm selling your Amiibo collection." <newline> A lightbulb flashed over my head. Martin glanced at it but his expression didn't change. He's probably used to my ingenious utilization of my abilities. <newline> "I have a fucking GREAT idea," I said confidently. <newline> ~-~3 HOURS LATER, POLICE STATION~-~ <newline> "I think this might be what the Ancient Maori called a failure," Martin said, his handcuffs jangling. "Though, generally speaking, robbing a convenience store is considered a bad idea." <newline> "What did we say about this vibe-icide, Martin," I replied. "Look at the positive side. Now we know that I already used super strength. This is what the Gandhi called "a learning experience." <newline> "Gandhi never said things like that," Martin said. <newline> "Fuck you, Martin."
For eons our kind has walked along the precipice of the great dark. We collect the great stars which gleam like gems within the galaxy, adding them to our treasury. For it is there that we find the greatest of comforts - life. Hollowed and sacred, beautiful and wild, the stars provide us with the nourishment our species craves to continue to thrive and grow. We consume these entities like a malnourished child would take to the bowl of food handed to them. Gorging ourselves on rock and iron, drinking in the effervescent as we rip into the very flesh of their foundation. The stars with pity and admonishment must watch as we gorge ourselves on their children, knowing not what fate awaits it as well. <newline> In the distance of the great dark we could see the finest of treasures that awaited us. A gleaming ember stone nestled within the coal, it glinted and shines with such allure that for many we told stories of its rich and bountiful feast. We knew not what would await us there, only that when we arrived we would be sated for a time being. Our iron ships carried us forth slowly but surely, rowing amongst the ocean of stars, fruits hanging waiting for them to be picked. With each thrust of our oars we created wakes within the waters, rippling out, sending signals to all who would listen - be afraid, for we hunger. <newline> As we approached closer, but only a few hundred generations away, our technomancers weaved great tales of what they saw in their artificial lenses. A planet of blue and marble - the rarest of all treats. It meant hydrogen and oxygen, a soft crust with an iron core. As that world spun, dancing like a care free child, we thought of our hungering bellies and continued to prowl forever towards it. We knew we would have our feast soon, and we weaved that tale for our future generations. <newline> Such a horror it was than for what they had discovered. As they entered in the final horizon of their long journey, as they began to approach their long told legacy; beating their chests like a war drum shouting "KNEEL BEFORE OUR POWER AND WEEP AS WE CONSUME", they discovered not the blue marble, but a gray husk. <newline> A shell of a forgotten memory, a planet not rife with life and oceans, not of soft crust and an iron core, not saturated in the bliss of oxygen. A wasteland, littered with the etchings of abandoned steel monstrosities; behemoths which shot from the ground. Amongst its ruins of cobble and stone, laying beneath the beams of steel, lay the forgotten memories of ghosts who left this place to ruin. The air tainted with radiation, sickness, and decay. In the rot that was to be our feast we found our own sickness - fear. Whoever had tainted this hunt, surely we would have no choice but to beg them for mercy in fear.
Everybody in town knew the stories, half barely believed, half denied, but all wanted nothing to do with it. Every now and again you’ll see some idiots trying to dare their friends to do it. The Maledictus Andron Motel. <newline> Made in 1944 by a Mr. Andron it was unique as a motel with only one hallway but 10 rooms. Every year on the anniversary of its creation it was reported that someone in town had gone missing and their last known location was the motel. It began a rumor that Mr. Andron was a follower of the occult and was killing his guest. Whether it was true or not, the public believed and chased him out of town. It’s said that if you try to walk it’s one hallway, past every room you’ll hear a voice trying to get you to let them free. If you open the door though you’ll be forced to take their place. <newline> Like I said every now and again you’ll see some idiots try to get their friend to walk that cursed hallway. Well today I’m the idiot. <newline> “Go on Jack or are you going to wimp out again like you do asking Samantha out?” <newline> “Fuck you David, I said I’m going to.” <newline> “Remember you got to take the key with you and close the door behind you.” <newline> “Yeah, yeah, piss off.” <newline> *Why the hell did I agree to this?* I thought as I could feel the knot in my stomach tighten like a boa constrictor strangling its prey. My heart beating fast enough to pump jet fuel into a plane. Maybe if I actually did this I would quit being afraid and finally ask her out. <newline> As I enter the motel I take one last look towards my “friends” as I close the door behind me. The game begins. As I start walking down the one hallway I keep thinking it’s just some dumb rumor right? Then as I pass the first door, I hear it. <newline> “Hey there, can you open this door for me?” “I seem to have locked myself in.” “Come on I can hear you out there.” “Hey if you let me out I got some candy for ya.” <newline> A male voice, a rather lame offer to be honest. However, I was told it was far better to just keep silent and keep going. If you talk back they’ll only get more aggravated and desperate to get you to open their door. <newline> I could feel my heart turn colder than dry ice and my eyes open as wide as possible finding out the rumors were actually true. I tried to turn around and leave but the entrance door was gone. If the rumors were fully true then the only way out was another door at the end of the hall. Well one down, nine more to go.
The Great Council convened on the day of Ascension, and tasked ourselves to elevate a new species into the position long held by humanity. <newline> The chimpanzee was an easy choice, and while there were no votes against, the Council thought it best to choose outside of the Primate family. There were nods in agreement, that although they were worthy, and nominally in their own stone age, they would repeat the same mistakes as humanity in its technological infancy. <newline> The next speaker offered the majestic dolphin. Again there were nods of agreement, and the lone vote against won the argument. For they do not have dextrous limbs, their ascent into humanity's position would be arduous at best. At this, another added the dolphin's propensity for casual violence when it suited them, a trait that humanity had long grappled with. <newline> Another member offered the crow. As one of the most intelligent species on the planet, they would quickly rise into prominence, given the proper nudge. A lone dissenter raised their voice, that their memory was long and bent to vindictive ends, and like the dolphin, ought not be rewarded with this higher station among life. <newline> There was a brief lull as several among us talked at once, and our communicators sorted out these conversations. The three were offered again, in modified terms, and with stipulations on their behaviors. We would oversee them as guides, but this line of discussion was rapidly dismissed for putting ourselves in the position of their deities, something we as a group were loathe to do. <newline> In the brief moment of silence, I offered the octopus. They were dextrous enough to wield tools, and intelligent enough to drive their forward progress with minimal assistance. Their lone weakness at this juncture was their lifespan, a singular modification that could be made and forgotten. <newline> The Council considered my proposal in a flurry of simultaneous, impassioned speeches and counterarguments, and in the end, a vote was made and the octopi were granted a tenfold increase in lifespan, without excluding the other worthy species of their future progress. When these noble creatures dream, they will dream of the stars, and their future among them. So sayeth we.
I leapt over another abandoned car that was more scrap than car by that point. Hundreds of them had been lined up to protect this place. Greenville Mall. It looked mostly like it did in the brochure. Except for the salvaged car doors and rubbish lining the walls. And how the “M” in “mall” had been turned around to spell “Greenville Wall.” I didn’t care about the state of the place as long as there was still an orthodontist in spot 42, like the brochure promised. And if they had a doctor for Peter, of course. That was the most important thing… Obviously. <newline> “Hello, i/θ/ there anybody in there?” <newline> A burly man appeared on the second floor. There had clearly been a glass front there, which they had shattered and mounted a cannon there for defense. The man wore a stained wife beater and a “MAGA” hat. “What do you want?” <newline> Oh boy, I thought. I was hoping this wouldn’t get political. I pointed to my friend just behind me, dragging himself over the wall of cars. “Plea/θ/e, we need a doctor.” <newline> “What’s wrong with your accent? Are you a foreigner or something?” <newline> I sighed and flashed my teeth. “B/w/aces.” <newline> “Oh, alright. Just as long as you aren’t a foreigner.” <newline> “Nope, definitely aren’t foreigners.” Although, I didn’t see how it mattered to him since there were no jobs for us to steal. “Can you help my f/w/iend?” <newline> He started working on a pulley for the garage door that had been fitted over the main entrance. “Sure. We only have one of those teeth doctors, but he should be able to help.” <newline> “What kind of teeth doctor?” <newline> “One of those orthodentists.” <newline> “You have an orthodontist!” I slid under the garage door that was only still half open and was about to sprint to space 42 when Peter called from the outside, “Garry, wait for me.” <newline> “Right, /θ/orry.” I stood in place and shook with excitement. The mall had been remade in a “doomsday preppers” fashion. The “Jim and the Juices,” had been lined with canned food. The “Gop,” was filled with military camouflage and the salespeople all wore gas masks. Nearly everyone had a gun, and even some of the few kids had knives larger than their forearms. <newline> Peter caught up and we edged towards the orthodontist. He was sweating badly now, and he was pale as hell. <newline> “Thanks again for /θ/aving me earlier.” I started. <newline> “Don’t worry about it,” Peter said. “I’ll be right as rain soon enough. And you’ll finally lose your braces.” <newline> We hadn’t been traveling together for long, but Peter had been dependable. He had taken pity on me because of my lisp. Said he cared about those who couldn’t speak their mind clearly. <newline> Space 42 was one of the few spaces that hadn’t been completely reconstructed for the apocalypse. Although a few utensils seemed out of place for a dental clinic. The bone saw came to mind. <newline> I plopped Peter in the dentist’s chair and knocked on the office in the back. “Hello, we need a doctor.” <newline> A scrawny man in a white robe came out. “What is it?” <newline> “My f/w/iend’s leg got hurt in a /θ/cuffle.” <newline> “Hurt in a what?” <newline> “/θ/cuffle.” <newline> ”What?” <newline> “A tussle, a fight, a brawl.” <newline> “Ahh, a scuffle.” <newline> “Yes.” <newline> He put his finger in my mouth and ran them across my teeth. “Do you need me to take those braces out?” <newline> “Yes, plea/θ/e.” I pointed to the chair. “But Peter first.” <newline> Peter’s eyelids were drooping as the dentist came to examine him. “Your friend doesn’t look so good. He hasn’t been bit has he?” <newline> “No, that would be a /w/eally unsatisfying conclusion to this whole thing.” <newline> “Where is he hurt?” <newline> “The leg.” <newline> As the doctor examined Peter, I heard a loud bang from where we came from. And after that the shuffling of feet and gunshots. Our burly friend from before ran past and I called out, “What’s happening?” <newline> “Liberals at the wall.” <newline> I looked at him in disbelief. “Don’t you mean /θ/ombies?” <newline> “Yes, but they’re all wearing ‘not my president’ t-shirts” <newline> “How i/θ/ that even relevant?!” <newline> “Clearly liberal zombies are worse than regular zombies,” he said, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. And then he ran off. <newline> This better not be an analogy for the pervasive nature of political fundamentalism or whatever, I thought. <newline> Behind me, I heard a low growl and turned around to see Peter propped up in his seat. Except his eyes were a milky cataract and his skin a sickly green. The orthodontist was kneeling next to him, exposing Peter’s clearly bitten calf. <newline> “Dentist,” I yelled as Zombie Peter bit a sizable chunk of flesh out of his neck. <newline> “God damn it Peter.” I pulled out my revolver and shot him in the head. Then I rushed over to the dentist that was on the floor, with his back to the medicine cabinet. <newline> “You said he hadn’t been bit.” <newline> “I didn’t know, I thought that was just a /θ/tereotype,” I said as I tried to apply pressure to his jugular. <newline> “You think you still have it in you to remove my b/w/aces?” <newline> He leaned in closer. “No, you asshole.” <newline> A loud bang came from the entrance again. I dropped the orthodontist and looked towards the scuffle. The zombies had broken the garage door at the entrance and were fighting with the gas mask wearing Gop employees. They really were liberal zombies. Some had their man buns intact and one even held a “Not my president” sign. Which was really quite silly since all the presidential candidates had become zombies and society as we knew had crumbled. <newline> The things some people care about, I thought, as I snuck out the back to continue my quest for dental care in the apocalypse.
It was a snowy day. Cold, icy, and just dreadful for a sorcerer to go out and about causing mayhem or helping those that need it. Whatever mood I felt like really. I've mastered a lot of things in my life with the art of magic. The good, the bad, and the useless. Pranks have gotten old, helping those in need is borderline thankless anymore, and going evil just causes more grey hair than what is worth it. <newline> I'm bored. I'm sitting here in front of my fireplace staring into the hypnotizing chaos of the dancing flames. What can I do? I have a small terrarium that has flourished, I am basically their god as they see it and I have grown attached to them. I can't just destroy them, but they don't really need me. Nothing really does. <newline> I've scrolled through my spell books that scatter the walls and my floor. Looking for something to do, something to create or destroy. Nothing though. I know these spells, I know what they can do and they disinterest me. But wait. What is this hidden under a stack of old magazines that I got while traveling through time and space? Ah my first spell book from when I was just a young, blonde haired wizard fresh out school. This takes me back. I was young, I had no wrinkles, no grey hair, hell even no beard. It was a wonderful time when the world was a mystery and I was determined to find out all about it. There was one thing that was cautioned to us throughout all of our teaching as I recall. Familiars are a simple roll of the dice and you have no control as to what you get. I had a friend that summoned one once. He was cast out of the school forever and I never had the chance to talk to him again. Now that I think about it I should have taken some time to find him. Oh well. <newline> I don't like to brag but I have to be one of the more powerful sorcerers in the world. I'm one of the oldest, I've conquered and relinquished land and kingdoms, I've taken on other spell users as my apprentices. I've done it all except this one thing. Hmm. Well it wouldn't hurt to find out what I need to do to summon it I suppose. <newline> A circle of salt, marble, ash from an oak log, a heart, and a drop of my own blood. <newline> Strange but simple enough. I thought to myself seeing as how this is so simple with its ingredients, how can this be dangerous. So as I have nothing else to do I gather up the materials, place them as instructed, slice open my hand and recite a short verse from the book. <newline> Nothing happened. I sat there waiting for some marvelous thing and there was nothing. I waited for what had to be a half hour before I got this strange feeling like I was being lifted up. With the sound of a pop I appeared in front of what looked like a larger version of me I suppose. This larger figured said with a booming voice "we are bonded by blood and you are my familiar now. You are free to do as you please unless I give you a command. Do you understand?" <newline> I said in a voice that attempted to demand respect "do you know who I am? I can cast you into oblivion if you don't show me the proper respect". The larger figure laughed and said "Attempt this if you wish but if you fail will you accept what I said". I replied with a yes and readied the most powerful spell I had. I called it the End Bringer. After casting it the figure sneezed. That was it. He sneezed at my spell. I sat there in awe as he blew his nose and then nodded. <newline> "Good, now that we have this settled. I am stuck here in my tower. I am bored, let's play a game."
“Hah. Now that’s a sight you don’t see every day.” A voice said behind me, “A literal vampire sunbathing out on a public beach.” <newline> “A what now?” I said, not getting up from my comfortable position laying on my towel, “I think you’ve got the wrong being, sir. I’m just a humble human doing a tan.” <newline> “No, you match Grervord’s description perfectly and I’ve been tracking you for months. You’re definitely him.” The voice said behind me. <newline> “Ah, well, you’ve got me. Congratulations.” I said, sitting up with a sigh and turning around. I looked at the man from over my sunglasses, “I assume you’re a bounty hunter?” <newline> “That’s right,” The man said. He was fully suited and had two crossbows slung across his back, “You seem… awfully passive for someone who’s about to be captured.” <newline> “Yeah,” I said, offering my hands for him to handcuff, “I’ve realized several centuries ago that there’s no use living in fear all the time if they're eventually gonna get me anyways. Might as well just let them capture me, do whatever tests they want, and then live a peaceful life after they’re done.” <newline> “You’re not scared of what they’ll do or anything? What if they decapitate you or something?” The man clicked the cuffs on and led me to his car. <newline> “Oh, no that’s not a big deal. I don’t feel pain and I’m completely immortal. The only thing that pains me is if they don’t have good food. Usually, if I’m nice they’ll give me some, though.” <newline> “Ah… I see… well.” The man seemed lost for words, “That’s nice.” We reached the car and he opened the passenger seat door for me. <newline> “Thanks,” I said, and ducked into the seat, “Oh yeah, could I get a shirt, please? Vampires hate seeing me with a tan. Makes them awfully jealous.” <newline> The man glanced at my tanned bare chest and frowned, “Sure… I guess, since you’re being so cooperative, why not?” <newline> “Also could we get a slushy or something on the way? I left my drink behind when you captured me.” <newline> The man sighed heavily, “Yeah, yeah, whatever.” <newline> ___ <newline>
"Am I really in Hell?" <newline> John asked the red demon. <newline> "What's that smell?" <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> "It's peppermint," the demon replied <newline> "If you want to get home, <newline> I'll dressed and give you a ride." <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> "You're a demon, how do I trust you?" <newline> John asked the robed demon. <newline> It shrugged. "I could ask the same of you. <newline> You're the one intruding in my home." <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> "Don't worry, it happens all the time. <newline> I'll take you to an exit gate. <newline> But just so you know, you have to wait." <newline> He grinned, "and it's a *hell* of a line." <newline> or my blog.

You never could tell. That's why i love this game. <newline>  <newline> Marcath sits across from me. A large wooden table between us. <newline> He frowns, as he ponders. <newline> Marcath is an orc. As in big, tough, green. Has an axe called the Bone cleaver. In HnH (Humans and Houses) He's a 23 year old Introverted woman named Helen, with glasses and three cats. <newline> In game, its Friday night, Helen has had two glasses of wine. The rest of the party, having survived an intense 8 hour office day, had voted for a long rest. The Orc had rolled on the "Table of inebriation, scoring up a 92 on his percent die. "Do something time consuming, and potentially dangerous." <newline> The Orc had fallen silent. Then he comes up with a plan. It's genius. <newline> I ask him again. "So, you want to put a sailor costume on your cat?" <newline> "Yes." He says, with no hint of bashfulness. He takes a sip of Mead from his Skull goblet. <newline> A chorus of voices from the other players. <newline> "Ooooooh, you're gonna need to roll for that." The Dwarf, now standing on his chair says from behind his beard. <newline> "She's gonna post them online." Trinabelle, Half elf looks up from her flawless-handwriting- filled record keeping. <newline> "That'll raise her status in the cat fanciers club too, that's a bold strategy." The teifling says, fingers steepled. <newline> This is my favourite part. They're invested. Anything could happen. <newline> "Charisma or Dex, your choice, I'll add your animal handling skill." I say, leaning back in my chair with a look of satisfaction. Heads swivel back to Marcath. <newline> "Do i have proficiency?" <newline> "Cat people have proficiency, yes." <newline> Nobody speaks. The table holding its breath, whilst he makes the call. After a few seconds he looks up, his eyes give the look of an Orc who has nothing to lose, and is leaving his fate in the hands of the fickle dice gods. <newline> It's risky. He's got good Dex. His Charisma isn't unreal though. <newline> "I look into the maw of Mister muggins. He should be the easiest target. and he's a soft touch for tuna." Marcath steeples his fingers, dredging cat related tactics from his book. I roll to Cajole. <newline> In unison heads swivel to me again. "DC18" <newline> His dice are black stone. Orcish numerals inscript its sides. When it rolls, it rolls with finality, like something weighing several hundred very small tonnes. The dice shows a fifteen. They look at me expectantly. <newline> "An 18. you are successful in your task." <newline> There's an enormous cheer from the table. Marcath looks pleased. I close my DM folder with a regrettable sigh. "And that's all i have time for tonight guys." <newline> "Aaaawwww" they say. But it's late, and i have work tomorrow. Which they all think is really cool for some reason. <newline> "So next week then?" I say getting to my feet. "Just summon me like normal hey?" The teifling nods. They all say their goodbyes, and he starts to chant a dispelling ritual. <newline> As i leave i hear the elf say <newline> "A game of HnH with an actual Human to HM for us. We are such nerds, guys." <newline> I smile, happily. As the excited voices fade along with the table and the waving silhouettes. Tonight i created a realm in which an Orc could dress a cat, in a sailor costume. That has to be a first. I'll write the scene tomorrow evening i think. <newline> An evening with the dice could bring anything. <newline> You could never tell. <newline> That's why I love this game.
"Gj'rhk vrgh'rt r'sssshch?" <newline> I look up from my lunch and in the direction of whatever made that guttural growl. <newline> "Rgh sh'djr?" <newline> Turns out it's from whatever creature is sitting on the barstool to my right. It seems to be asking something while gesturing towards my right ear. <newline> "Oh, right, wait a second." I answer him while giving the device on my aforementioned ear two quick taps. I immediately hear the words 'Universal Translation: On' from the device, and the alien visibly shows approval. <newline> "Sorry, my translator shuts itself down without warning every hour or so. I should really get it checked." <newline> "No biggie, technology always seems to let us down, no matter what species makes it," says the alien. <newline> I used to find communicating with the Universal Translator quite disturbing, as the sounds that it makes are always out of sync with the mouth movements of whatever alien I was talking to. It was even worse when communicating with a species that didn't even speak with their mouth. Felt like I they were communicating directly with my mind. However, just like everything that came with the job, I had a lot of time to get used to it. <newline> "Were you trying to ask me something?" <newline> "Is that black vessel parked outside the door yours?" <newline> I give them a nod. <newline> The alien's eye stalks light up. <newline> "That's an EroniteTech V66 right?" <newline> "Sure is. Limited Royal Edition." <newline> "Wow. How did a *human* like you manage to get your hands on one?", they ask excitedly. From their emphasis on the word 'human', it seems that the alien is aware of the fate that befell the human race. <newline> God knows how many times I've been asked this question on this trip alone. Might already be in triple digits. But to be fair, I've always appreciated people showing enthusiasm for my work, even if it's only for the hardware involved. I make sure to take a good sip out of my drink before answering, as I don't really want my throat to run dry in case this turns into a long conversation. <newline> "Well, it's not really mine. I'm just, um, driving it as part of my job." <newline> "Are you... a test pilot or something?" <newline> The alien's answer gives me a slight chuckle. <newline> "No, no, nothing as glamorous. The owner just asked me to deliver it to the dealer at Eropolis-Alpha for some minor repairs." <newline> "E-Alpha?! But that's at least two light decades from Earth, right?" <newline> "Yep. You were so surprised you knocked over a couple of your foodballs y'know?" <newline> The alien looks down to the floor. Sure enough, a pink-ish grey ball of foodstuff is laying there, while another ball is still rolling away, probably heading out towards the door. <newline> "Damnit. I'd usually just pick them up and eat it but interstellar rest areas usually don't have the cleanest floor." <newline> "Trust me, I've been to enough of these places to know that you *do not* want to eat anything off these floors," I assure him while taking a bite out of my own meal, just in case it meets a similar fate to the alien's foodballs in the near future. <newline> "Anyway, I hope you don't mind me asking this but..." Their voice trails away, and the alien is left unsure whether they are going to continue their question or not. <newline> My curiosity gets the best of me and I urge them to continue. <newline> "Well..." <newline> I give them a reassuring nod. <newline> "...doesn't your species only live to around 150? The V66 *is* a fast ship, but still, by the time you get there..." <newline> "Well, my employers made me biologically immortal, so it's not an issue. I've been to Eropolis-Alpha a few times by now." <newline> "They have an Eronite V66 *and* can conduct immortality procedures... Are you working for..." <newline> "Yep, I work for the Eronites. Supreme race of the galaxy and all." <newline> Surprisingly, the alien didn't really find this to be all that awe-inspiring. Instead, their next question was more of a question of concern. <newline> "Aren't you lonely?" <newline> ... <newline> A few decades later, sitting on my custom human-sized seat in the cockpit of the V66, I still occasionally recall the alien's question. The Eronites, owing to their virtually unending life spans, seem to operate on a different time scale than most species. Their equivalent to what humans consider a day is probably closer to half a century, so it comes as no surprise that my employer can spend around two decades sleeping, followed by around 30 years of activity. <newline> Just like everything else that came with the job, I had a lot of time to get used to it. These days I find myself more and more viewing time through an Eronite perspective, viewing days and weeks as insignificant as humans used to view seconds. Of course my physiology still demands I follow a 24-hour sleep cycle, but everything else seems to happen on a much grander scale. <newline> However, unlike everything else that came with the job, I never got used to the loneliness. Every time I leave Earth, I know that the human life waiting for me when I arrive will be pretty much unrecognizable. Yet retreating to my employer's garage for decades while I wait for the next assignment in a much more stable environment doesn't seem to get any easier. <newline> Oh well. <newline> At least the immortality was worth it, right? Right?
The day I died was uneventful. Well.. Apart from my death, obviously. Typical heartattack. Lorraine would be saying 'I told you so' right now if I wasn't lying dead in the middle of the living room, and on the good rug no less. But as I stood over my body and watched my family sob all I felt was excitement. So far it was as they'd all said. Those that had died in surgery and been brought back or those on the brink of death, they'd all said the same thing: out of body experience, watching yourself with that detached feeling and then it had happened. Death had offered them a wish. <newline> Glancing round the room it all looked the same, just slightly... Distant? Like that feeling when you're in a dream and intuitively you know it's your house but it just doesn't quite feel right. You know the feeling. But Death wasn't here; I was all alone. <newline> "Ahhh that'll be it" I thought to myself as I watched my wife frantically explaining the situation to the paramedics. "Yes that's it, I'm not going to *actually* die, that's why Death isn't here." Lorraine was knelt on the floor, covering her mouth with her hands as she watched the first responders list off stats and strange words to each other as they tried to bring me back. <newline> Leaving the chaos behind me I went into the kitchen. Cereal and milk was spread across the floor, intermixed with shards of what was presumably the bowl. As I stepped over the mess I realised I still had a very faint need to urinate, the reason I'd gotten up from the breakfast table in the first place. Could ghosts pee? I weighed it up in my mind but curiosity got the best of me and I headed over to the sink. Lorraine was still loudly crying in the next room. A few hysterics words drifted through the open door. I was sure i heard "I told him this would happen". <newline> Huh. So ghosts could pee. Interesting. Of course it did look a bit weird... <newline> "WHAT THE FUCK?" The voice seemed to echo throughout the whole room and bounce around inside my head. I span round to see a man, dressed completely in black, standing in my kitchen. Except he wasn't *dressed* in black, it was almost like the darkness just curled around him. And he wasn't a man. The closest description would be a skeleton, I suppose but that's not what he was either. <newline> After a moments shock I realised the absurdity of the scene and tried to hurriedly explain myself but the man cut me off. <newline> "You were trying to see if ghosts could pee, I get it, happens all the time don't worry about it" He said quickly, but his expression told me this most certainly did not happen all the time. Still, I appreciated the sentiment. Death sighed. <newline> "So... Uhh... Sorry I'm late, someone was very resistant to the whole dying idea and well.. Not important." <newline> "Oh don't worry I know how people can be about dying." I waved him off. <newline> After his apology, Death explained that I was in fact dead. And that I got a wish. The rules were simple, I couldn't wish anyone else dead and I couldn't wish to be back alive. He explained that most people wished for happiness for their families or to be able to give them a sign, like a butterfly or a bird landing on their windowsill or something. These options didn't appeal to me. <newline> Well Id already heard of these 'death wishes' and for a long time I'd known what I would wish for. A little homage to how I'd spent so much of my life. So I made my wish. <newline> "Seriously... You don't want some kind of comfort for your wife, are you sure? " Death looked around at Lorraine, still sobbing on the floor and insisting she warned me about cholesterol. <newline> "It's not against the rules is it?" I asked. <newline> "Well.. No but -" <newline> "Then that's what I want. I want them all to know it was me." <newline> Death sighed again and whispered hushed words into cupped hands. And the room suddenly started to spin. It was as if the world was in fast forward. The milk was cleared up, my sister put her arms around Lorraine as they both sobbed, day turned to night and dawn came around again. And eventually the world stopped spinning. <newline> Death gave me a curious glance and we settled on the sofa to watch as Lorraine turned on the news. I felt giddy with excitement. My face appeared on screen but there was a different name underneath. I watched as Lorraine mouthed the words, unable to comprehend their meaning. Death held his face in his hands, his knee bobbing up and down. He looked at me sideways but I was watching the TV. The news reporter was reading out a long list. My achievements. Though the word they used was "victims".
Day 132 <newline> Im pretty sure I've been able to feel some new magical atunement. When I started cleaning the tower today, I thought "I bet the sun is shining outside today" so I asked Geshtle about it and he smiled with a knowing look. I'm pretty sure that means yes. There aren't any windows in the tower so I can't confirm it but I just have a feeling.  <newline> Geshtle says that all of the training I'm getting is definitely paying off. He says that once I can tell the weather successfully 12 days in a row that he'll start teaching me real spells. I can't wait!  <newline> Day 145 <newline> Cleaning out the dragon den today was hard. That jerk Smaugreus knows no chill. Thankfully I haven't lost any more fingers. Geshtle says Ill be able to grow them back once I'm advanced enough anyway.  <newline> When I was dusting and sweeping in the library today I noticed a thick book labeled "Apprenticeship" I thought the quotes around the word were strange but who knows if English is the Wizards first language. I opened it up and found hundreds of names and dates going back almost a thousand years! This Gheshtle must be a really awesome wizard to have trained so many, and it only reinforced how special it was for him to pick me.  <newline> Day 300 <newline> It seems like only yesterday I was daydreaming at school, wishing the world was more interesting. Then he showed up, popped right out of the air, and made eye contact with me. He said  <newline> "Oi, you wanna learn magics and such?"  <newline> Oh boy I just KNEW my destiny wasn't some boring law school! I grabbed his hand, we popped back to the tower and I haven't looked back since.  <newline> Anyway, those cauldrons aren't going to clean themselves, back to it! <newline> Day 547 <newline> This will be the 100th time I've mopped the floor of the kitchen, but at least the goblins didn't get into the lard again. I couldnt wash the smell of that out for days.  <newline> I predicted the weather 7 days in a row this week! I'm sure my true training is just around the corner. Sure would be nice if I could see the sky though…  <newline> Day ?? <newline> My hands are so dry… and… wrinkled? That can't be right. Must be a trick or the light. Geshtle hasn't aged a day so I'm sure it hasn't been that long. After organizing the library today I found the "Apprentice" book again and found a few new names in it but.. doesn't make sense. Its just me and the Wizard here. <newline>  Been tired a lot lately. Might just go to bed early tonight. Hard to mop the kitchens ever since the dragon got my leg last.. week? Or, hang on… last year? Something like that.  <newline> Today was the 11th day in a row I predicted the weather. Just one more day. One more day and I'll begin my real training…. Sleep for now though.  <newline> No further entries.
The celebration was short-lived. <newline> Yes, Humanity had finally broken through the ultimate barrier. Yes, we had entered a new era of possibility and development. Yes, we were no longer bound by such trivial things as space and time. <newline> But we quickly came to understand there were higher laws than the laws of nature. There were rules and regulations that governed what we had once imagined as the ungovernable. <newline> A system lay beyond the system we had evolved within. A more elaborate and complicated one. One that channeled impossible power to orchestrate its will. One tasked with keeping the very fabric of reality intact for those who had acquired the position to tear the threads of existence. <newline> When we set forth as species into that great unknown, we left one set of rules and became bound by another. <newline> We discovered this fact when we were contacted. <newline> We began to understand the implications when we saw the fine. <newline> We only began to understand the consequences when all of Humanity was forced to attend Intergalactic Traffic School. <newline> I will explain. <newline> The arrival of the alien representative was sudden and dramatic. Sudden because Barrister X'colonnn appeared 2.3 zeptoseconds after the *Faraway Future* made the transition out of our solar system and into the history books. Dramatic because the Barrister appeared to all members of Humanity simultaneously and spoke in fluent vernacular. <newline> Barrister X'colonnn's message was polite but to the point. I shall relay it here. <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> &gt;Greetings, Humanity. Congratulations on piercing the light veil. This is a large accomplishment in the evolution of any species, and it would typically warrant a celebration. Unfortunately, Humanity's means of piercing the veil is in violation of numerous ordinances, both metaphysical and quasimological in nature. As warnings were clearly posted, we can only assume the transgression was deliberate. Due to the severity of the infraction, we are required to immediately intervene on behalf of all Fabric Tenders and place Humanity in temporary stasis until it has completed its remediation plan. <newline> This announcement was immediately followed by the sky shifting to a dull, endless aquamarine, as the planet Earth was removed from standard physical space and placed into a pocket dimension known colloquially as "Traffic School." <newline> You might expect that Humanity reacted to these events well. After all, we pride ourselves on our rationality and had just accomplished a step function accomplishment for the species. <newline> The rioting was in full swing when Barrister X'colonnn made a second appearance and explained the "remediation plan." Rioting escalated considerably at that point. Humanity did not appreciate the prospect of spending a thousand years in "constructive education" about the "dangers of tearing the fabric of space/time and generally being a menace to the neighborhood." <newline> Naturally, we sought a diplomatic resolution. The Fabric Tenders were open to the possibility so long as Humanity would designate a single representative that could contractually bind all of Humanity. <newline> You might expect that Humanity reacted to this opportunity well. After all, we pride ourselves on our ability to compromise and work toward the common good. <newline> The Representative War was in full swing when Barrister X'colonnn made a third appearance and provided a report on Humanity's progress. Warfare escalated considerably at that point. Humanity did not appreciate being told that they had actually made negative progress in the first nine years of Traffic School on account that we had killed so many people along the way. <newline> Naturally, we sought a destructive resolution. The Fabric Tenders' space compound, which floated on the edge of the pocket dimension, was assaulted by what meager forces the remainder of Humanity could muster to the cause. We successfully destroyed the Fabric Tenders' outpost. <newline> You might expect that Humanity reacted to this victory well. After all, we pride ourselves on our magnanimity and general ability to rebuild after a conflict. <newline> The Salvage Decimation was in full swing when Barrister M'polongo made a first appearance (fourth for the Fabric Tenders generally) and explained that Humanity had incurred a second infraction due to their decision to assassinate dear Barrister X'colonnn. Humanity was then placed into a second pocket dimension along with another planet containing a species that was also on probation. <newline> You might expect that Humanity reacted to this chance for alliance well. After all, we pride ourselves on our ability to build bridges in common cause with other downtrodden beings. <newline> The Fuck Those Guys on the Other Planet Conflict was in full swing when Barrister M'polongo made a second appearance (fifth for the Fabric Tenders generally) and explained that Humanity were being proper assholes about the entire situation. None of the Tenders had ever seen anything like it. Humanity was now receiving a third infraction on account of us genociding the other planet. We were then placed into a third pocket dimension where the sky periodically rains hellfire. <newline> You might expect that Humanity reacted to this trying situation well. After all, we're a durable species with considerable capacity to adapt and move beyond adversity. <newline> The Great Koolaid Guzzling Competition was in full swing when Barrister M'polongo made a third appearance (sixth for the Fabric Tenders generally) and mostly just stared at those few of us that were left. We had run out of Koolaid to drink and were mostly just milling about our bunkers bored. <newline> Barrister M'polongo opened their maw and raised an appendage, as if to speak. Slowly, it dropped the appendage and then closed its maw. Then the Barrister blinked from existence. <newline> Since we didn't end up in another pocket dimension, I'm taking that as a good sign. <newline> **Platypus OUT.** <newline> **Want MOAR
"Welcome Lord Kirsharch" <newline> The flames vanished like they come out in the middle of the room when the man step out of the flames. He was so busy with stroke his goatee beard he didn't even respond the woman who welcomed him. <newline> The woman follow him for a few steps and asks without skipping a beat <newline> "You are quick to return my lord" <newline> The man stop and turn around and look at her with a fiersome gaze. But woman can see the tiredness behind it. <newline> "It was just a boy, Mai." he respond. <newline> Mai didn't stutter but her eyes got wide for a second. <newline> "But, sir. Didn't he defeated everything on his path?" <newline> "Yeah" he saidi with an expression rarely seen. One can see how his hopes and dreams got crashed. <newline> "But, sir. That means he pass the test then? Why don't you..." <newline> "fight him?" his voice question the woman but he was shaking his head with disapprove. When he see the confusion in Mai's eyes he let a sigh and go to the table where a strong alcohol waiting for him. He starts talking while put a shot for himself. <newline> "They call me overlord, Mai. A tyrant. A ruler..." <newline> He raise the glass like he toss to someone invisible and bottoms up. After a second making a sour face he continue. <newline> "But all i did beating challenges. Challenge by quest givers. An old woman who's too weak to search for his husband go to war. A challenge given by a thief who wants to scheme someone. A challenge by a king who wants to slay a dragon so they can catch a break for their civil war. A challenge by a god who wants to take their artifact. A challenge by titans who's too busy with their own politics in their dimension." <newline> He shake his head again and looking at his clothes. They were fabric but Mai knows how many months Kirsharch work on enchantments over enchantments put into those fabric of clothes. she waited patiently while her lord put another glass of shot and continue. <newline> "I met a warrior once. It was my last true mission before all...this" <newline> He wave his glass without spilling the drink. It was a simple circle-like motion but he was obviously talking about everything he owns. <newline> "She got many names but when i met her she's known as Dragonrider." <newline> While he chuckled a bit Mai got shocked. Even if you live under a rock you should heard of her as she was the most active person in the whole continent. There was no hole she didn't reach, no guild she didn't joined. She got not only has many skills but she also mastered them all. But it's been a while she didn't seen around. <newline> "She said she did every quest possible and now she was looking for a good fight to end instead of waiting to be death in her bed. I doubt even death itself would touch her though. Someone should handed her to death." <newline> When Mai think about it, it was around when Dragonrider disappeared when Lord Kirsharch started to climb the ladders quickly. <newline> "She said 'It was a good fight' but i heard her last spell. I knew she would come back in one way or another. It was 10 years ago." <newline> He make a sour face again. It was more like a disgust when he shouted to the room. <newline> "You have a sick sense of humour you know that! Why does it have to be this way!? You should know when i agree on leaving the town for that fight! You should know when i looked at those children playing tag! Why did it have to come to this!? I don't understand and i'm not going to fight until i understand you hear me!" <newline> He smahsed the glass to the ground and open a portal right next to him while still shouting to the void. <newline> "Well i'm not playing your games now! This isn't a chellange i'm looking for. I'm done. Bye!" <newline> He just slipped to the portal and disappeared. Mai didn't shocked but suprised as she murmurs herself. <newline> "This is the first time i saw him use a portal. I didn't know he can do that. Why didn't he use the flames? I wonder where he gone off?" <newline>
Don’t think you can just run all the time.” Enhance screamed over the ear splitting sound of gunfire filling the room. His bullets passed through me harmlessly as my power activated. <newline> “Listen man I know your mad and I admit I’ve done bad things, but I’m a new man I’m no longer The Wraith it’s Spectre now. I know we got some bad blood with Radiance, but I’m not to blame I've been trying to make up for the past I’m doing good now.” I pleaded as I once again activated my power to dive past a wall into my living room. I ran through the room going to my sos button. After a brief moment of consideration I pressed it a quiet beep of confirmation was heard as it sent a call for help. ‘It’ll take 5 minutes for her to get here I just need to not die for that long’ I thought to myself. The hard part of my power was that I could only do it for about 10 seconds before passing out.  <newline> “Make up for the past? Don’t make me laugh all you’re doing is manipulating the public and Radiance. That’s what you do and what you always do. A thief is always a thief.” He ranted as he started to reload his pistol. A brief glow of blue going over them from his power as he “enhanced” them. I grabbed my locator and activated my power to fall through the floor onto the main entrance hallway of my apartment block. Luckily it was late and no one was coherent enough to notice my descent.  <newline> I quickly ran out to the door however as soon as I was about to open it Enhance had jumped out my window landing right in front of the door. “You talk like something that happened in the past doesn’t matter. That everyone should just forget all the shit you’ve done. That you’re somehow better than the you in the past, but you’re still a thieving piece of shit to the heart!” He yelled as he pulled his trigger finger. I activated my power in response however I heard nothing. ‘He must know my limit fuck’ I cursed in my mind as I ran through him and the door. I ended my intagliability early, and knocked the gun out of his hand. Running to the parking garage on the other side of the street.  <newline> Instead of running to his gun he tackled me to the ground surprising me. I felt a shock of electricity from my lower side as he tased me. “Think you can run from me? Think you can just escape and be done with it? That if you just get far enough away it’ll stop being a problem?” He questioned slamming my head into the pavement. Instead of a crunch and blood splattering on the ground his hand just went right through my head as did the rest of his body. <newline> With a slight limp in my step I passed through the door to the parking garage. I looked back at the door and noticed that it was locked. ‘That’ll buy me some time’ I reached into my pockets to get my keys before realizing I left them in my apartment. The startling realization was punctuated by a loud banging sound from the door behind me. I quickly ran into the garage before picking a random car and phasing into it. It was some red old piece of junk, but that meant a large amount of legroom. I crawled into the bottom and lowered my head assuming a fetal position. <newline> I layed there in silence for a few minutes before hearing a crack in the window and the face of Enhance attop me. “Fun fact it appears Radiance never changed the locator signal after all.” he said with a grim smile upon his face. As soon I saw him however a bright flash came and then death.
Sleep, for the most part, was my favorite part about being demihuman. <newline> That whole undying part? Not so much. <newline> It's cold out here, in the vacuum. My limbs barely function and my eyes shift in and out of focus; they don't have much to concentrate on anymore. <newline> I wanna say it's been six, no, seven? Maybe eight millennia floating free-form. <newline> There are some wakening cycles where I'm at peace. Things are okay, I think back to the music they had. They had such wonderful taste; I don't think there was a genre I didn't like. The food, too. They loved their cooking. Not like the demihumans; they didn't care about tastes. They were too busy being "warriors." Cultivating themselves in battle. Now look at them, all dead, trying to win a war they would never see the end of. I left soon enough to be freed of the idiotic wounds they'd inflict on one another, the only thing that could kill an immortal, after all, was another immortal. <newline> My head throbbed in pain. Neurons regenerating as they died, my fingers cracking as I gripped. Your ears attenuate to the smallest sounds when you're out here long enough. <newline> The several stars I could see off in the distance; all part of some distant cosmic map I didn't even happen to be a blip on. Some creators we were. <newline> The light burned my retinas as I opened them for the first time. It felt, at first, like something reaching out to snatch me. Then, it happens again. Another pulse. My headache pangs return tenfold. I can try to yell out, but nothing comes of it. Only banshees get that benefit. <newline> The sounds start to form a complex rhythm. I could feel it, but I can't figure out what it is yet. What the hell was I looking at? What can travel faster than light? What WOULD travel faster than l- <newline> Then, it hit me. <newline> I'm gonna feel bad for that pilot when I wake up.
"Yes, that's it! Good I'll try that this time" Professor Hamlet said <newline> It was my assignment he was looking at, it was about how to stop 9/11, i just really threw an idea that i thought could work in theory. <newline> "What do you mean" almost the entire class said simultaneously. <newline> "Oh if it works, it wont matter to you" Hamlet said as he started jogging toward the door <newline> the class started asking questions-to many for me to hear- then Professor Hamlet stopped right before he exited the classroom like he forgot something <newline> he turned around and pointed to me and said "Ray, come with me, this is your idea after all." <newline> before i could respond he yanked me with him, out the classroom <newline> "stop!",we did. <newline> "what?" <newline> "where are we going?" <newline> "to stop nine eleven" <newline> "what?" <newline> "you heard me." <newline> i was at a loss of words, Mr. Hamlet saw this gave me an empathetic look with a smile and said <newline> "look, long story short, I can time travel, and I've been trying to stop tragedies because I wanted to see what would happen, and you're going to help me with this" <newline> with that we were on our way. After awhile of me trying to get words we stopped outside. <newline> "So, you ready?"Hamlet asked. <newline> "uh,uh no?" <newline> "well too bad, we don't have all day" he laughed at his own joke. <newline> with that, everything around us was turning white, and then we started fading into the cockpit on a plane, heading towards, the Twin Towers...
“Excuse me?” <newline> “The prisoner. What will you do with it?” I give the caretaker a weird look. I inherited a mansion from my grandfather, who was a retired German scientist, who dealt with genetic engineering and gene manipulation. The caretaker was one of his old colleagues. I’d been to this mansion multiple times over the years, but not once had I seen a prisoner. I ask the caretaker, <newline> “Where are they?” She laughs, and responds with, <newline> “Why, in the secret room of course!” She leads me to an empty wall, and cuts out an outline of a door in the wallpaper. I go to open it, and the caretaker grabs my arm. <newline> “I need to warn you, it’s extremely dangerous, so it’s been restrained. Do not remove ANY of the restraints.” I nod, and go inside. <newline> “W-who’s t-there....?” That was the first thing I heard when I went inside. I found a light switch, and flicked it on. In the center of the room, tied to a chair and inside a plexiglass prison, was a GIRL. She was about the same age as me, with matted hair, torn clothing, and dirty skin. She was dangerously thin, and she looked harmless. What set me off was that *she had the ears and tail of a wolf.* I noticed her eyes were covered, and she was shaking. <newline> “Hello....? Who are you?” I slowly approach the glass, and get a closer look at the girl. She looked around wildly, obviously scared, and replied, <newline> “I.... I don’t remember my name... who a-are YOU? Why are you in h-here? W-Where’re the s-scientists...?” I open the glass prison, then remember the caretaker’s warning. I choose to ignore the girl’s questions, and ask my own. <newline> “What happened to you? Who did this....?” <newline> “T-the scientists.... t-they took me.... made me int-to a monster.... I h-haven’t eaten s-since they relocated m-me from t-the lab...” *Poor thing...* I think. I look back at the door. My gut is screaming at me, telling me to help her. I hardly know what I’m doing, until the girl is released from the restraints. She collapses onto me, smiling. <newline> “Thank you.... T-thank you....” <newline> “Sir!! What are you doing?! I told you not to release it!!” I get up, the girl hiding behind me, and turn around to face the caretaker. <newline> “SHE was being mistreated! She’s barely able to speak! What did my grandfather do to her?” The girl behind me whimpers at my voice. The caretaker stops, then smiles. <newline> “Guess the cat’s out of the bag... Now I have to clean up the loose ends.... Wo hat der Chef das Transformationsserum wieder hingelegt...?” I feel my blood turn to ice as the plexiglass door closes, the caretaker locking the girl and I in, speaking German as she does. <newline> “Was für eine Schande... Ich dachte, Sie hätten die Arbeit des Chefs übernehmen können...” <newline>
The ship rumbled, causing tremors all across the earth. After 10 painstaking years we were finally going to see if we've done enough. The new world governments were confident that we were perfectly fine as we had destroyed all issues that faced us. The citizens were still nervous about such an outcome with some crying on the streets while others kept down their nerves with a drink. The ship screeched a deafening roar telling us to listen when a message was broadcast. A message we all dreaded. One that would make the strongest among us crumble under the pressure. "You have 1 year remaining" the ship bellowed onto the quivering populus below. <newline> The newspapers got on topic before anyone could even blink. Headlines sprawled across the front page reading "where did we go wrong" or "was it all a waste of time?". World leaders came together to see what there was left to do. World hunger? Solved. Climate change? Entirely fixed. The world spent days trying to come up with the issues the ship wanted us to fix. That's when we all realised. A ship this large sending out such a threatening message accompanied by the possibility of death, cannot be from a race of benevolent beings. <newline> Cults started forming. Anarchistic organisations hell bent on causing world havoc making us into savages once more. The governments of the world tried to stop us, telling us it wasnt the way but one by one they fell. First ot was Dubai, the richest of all countries fell to its knees and brutalised their own society. It wasn't long until the entire middle east fell, then Asia, then Africa, then the world. <newline> The last bastion for order was the unwavering stubbornness of Britain. They were too mixed up in their old traditions even now to buckle under the pressure. Our year was almost up with only a month to save ourselves. With neo-barbarian attack on all fronts it was only a matter of time before this bastion fell, and it did. Two weeks later a terrorist cult blew the countries infrastructure to smithereens, collapsing the markets until there was nothing left. With no more hope the county fell just like the rest of them. <newline> We looked to the sky on the day of judgement. Even now that we all fight for our own lives in hell we all stopped to hold each other to see if it was enough. I suppose our prayers were answered when the ship slowly left our orbit and out of sight but it felt quiet. It didnt feel like a victory or that we had survived certain doom. Look at us for fuck sake! We massacred each other to save ourselves and brought our lives misery just so that we could love in our eternal damnation. If this is how they wanted us to love then I'd rather not live at all. <newline> It comes to no surprise then that the suicide rate that day were higher than ever recorded. I guess even hell sounds good when all you feel is apathetic misery.
“What do you mean there’s no Bluetooth?” My teenage sister, Penny, whined. <newline> “Shush,” said mum, turning up the music. She smiled at dad. They were reliving their youth or something, it was awful. <newline> I stared blankly out the window of the company car, a black 1980 Aston Martin V8. Why did I have to come on this trip? I wanted to stay home. Instead, here I am, in this piece of shit old car. Or, new car, I guess. <newline> I don’t know much about dads work, other than that he had started as just an every-day, totally normal police officer shortly after finishing high school. Mom said he hated being a street officer. Something about witnessing a traumatic accident. Fast forward a few years of promotions and befriending some politicians, and he was hired to a time agency called “Compass.” This is when the secrecy started. No one except the employees and their families know what Compass does. We knew dad travelled through time to change potentially historical events, but he couldn’t tell us where or what he was doing. Then one day he dropped the bomb that the whole family had to go this time. <newline> “The boss says it’s gotta be all of us. This trip will change history, and we get to be a part of it!” He had told us enthusiastically. <newline> We were sedated in our own home and woke up in a motel in 1982. Hence the “old-new” car situation. Sure it was “new,” but it really was a piece of shit. <newline> We were given new identities and a folder full of paperwork and IDs to match them. Dad, previously Frank Cuddy, was now Gerald Humbert. Mom, Jane Cuddy, now Elma Humbert. Penny, now Sarah. And myself, once Jack, now Josh. Dad hadn’t even read the folder yet, I’d be surprised if he knew his new name. I only read it out of boredom because it was the only thing in the car other than the map. <newline> Mom was looking at the map now. Does she know how to use that thing? The destination had been circled in red and beside it was written, “Be there for 1400H on the dot, local time. Take highway 48.” <newline> I looked at the clock. 1338. I wish dad would drive faster, I’m hungry. Is there McDonald’s in 1982? I wish I had had more time to do some Google research before we left. Google. Google.... note to self. Invest in Google ASAP. <newline> A honking horn. A jolt of breaks. Screeching tires. <newline> Blackness. <newline> I wake up, my ears ringing, vision blurry. As I come-to I try to look around but I’m pinned and can’t move anything. My vision comes back slowly. I realize with terror the car is upside down. I hadn’t worn my seatbelt, stupid. The top half of my body is outside of the car, but the bottom is... inside? I can see a wrecked transport truck to my right. Did we hit that? There’s a clanking above me as I see a huge hook being placed in the car frame. <newline> A shadow comes above me. A police officer. He’s trying to have a poker face but emotion is creeping through. He looks familiar. I try to speak but I can’t seem to. Why is my throat so dry? <newline> “Vital signs absent on all but this one.” Says a paramedic nearby. He’s trying and failing to speak quietly to the police officer. “The only thing keeping him alive is the car on him. As soon as we lift it he’s going to bleed out immediately. We can’t do anything.” <newline> “Just pull it off and get it over with,” comes a third voice. <newline> “Excuse me?” Exclaims the Officer. “We still need to talk to the boy. This accident is suspicious and he’s a witness to it.” <newline> “He’s delirious, he surely can’t give an accurate statement.” The third man says impatiently. “If he can’t be saved, he can’t be saved. I have other cars to tow, so I’d like to get this done.” <newline> I squint in their direction. Is that... Dad’s boss from Compass? What was his name? Rick? He looks the exact same as when we saw him not even 24 hours ago, but with a shitty beard and a tow-truck driver uniform. <newline> “How dare you.” I hear the Officer say. “We don’t even know their names, we’ll need to notify their family.” He turns his back on Rick and starts talking to the paramedic. Rick walks toward the tow truck. <newline> Clanking begins again above me and suddenly the pressure on my waist is lifted. <newline> “Shit!” I hear the paramedic exclaim, “He’s bleeding out!” <newline> The officer runs over to me and kneels on the ground. He’s panicking, he’s trying to hold back tears in his eyes. “It’s okay boy,” he lies, “everything is going to be fine.” <newline> My eyes slowly move from his face to his name tag. Constable Frank Cuddy. Then everything fades to black. <newline>
A newbie to writing here. Thanks for reading my story. Any feedback will be appreciated. <newline>  <newline> It all started last summer. I was in possession of a newly minted English lit degree, a halfway written novel about witches and vampires, and all of forty-six dollars and eighteen cents in my bank account. Oh, and a spectacular student loan, let's not forget that. After failing to secure a well-paying, or even a halfway decent job offer, I was starting to get desperate. To make matters worse, my roommate moved out last week and the one new roommate candidate I've met with so far seriously gave me the creeps. In theory, I could ask my father to help me out. All I had to do is put up with a few hours of *"*I told you to study computer science" and "why can't you be more like your brother?". I wasn't that desperate yet. Deciding that it was time for me to get any job that would have me, I considered the options available on a short notice to a nerdy twenty-two-year-old who hasn't lifted anything heavier than a book in her entire life. After browsing the posts on a local online job board, I was contemplating the relative benefits of making frappuchinos vs. working in retail. That's when I noticed the ad for a call canter job. For a big local apparel brand no less. All the cool sorority girls and their mothers were dressed head to toe in this brand's clothing. "How hard can this call center gig be?" I thought to myself, sending my application. <newline> After an excruciatingly upbeat group interview, I got the job. Well, me and half of my interview group did. Turns out, they were really short staffed for some reason. And here I was worried that the only brand name item of clothing I could wear to the interview was a headband, given to me by my mother in high school in a futile effort to try and get me to exercise. I had a job to go to tomorrow, and even a possible solution to my rent money crisis. Jess, one of the girls from the interview was coming over to look at my apartment later that day. Things were looking up. <newline> Working at the call center was hectic, loud, and at times utterly infuriating. But the pay was good for sitting in an office answering phone calls and emails. I put on my cheery personality, sometimes faked a bad British accent, and tried to concentrate on the polite and sweet customers and not dwell on the rest. The room our desks were in had windows, that was a definite plus. Although there were eight desks between me and the nearest window. I made friends with a few coworkers. We spent our breaks trading stories of our most ridiculously demanding customers and making each other laugh before clocking back in. Even our supervisor Greg was not too bad, as far as corporate overlords go. True, he watched the time tracking software like a hawk, but he treated everyone the same and mostly stayed in his office unless there was a productivity problem. So what if I was having an occasional nightmare about being chased by a crowd of angry stay at home moms demanding to know where their socks were? <newline> What I didn't expect was the monotony of it all. After a few weeks, I memorized the scripted prompts, grew thicker skin, and settled into a routine. Help someone find the exact color lilac they were looking for here, get screamed at for our returns policy there, it all started to blend into very dull workdays. My skin, unhappy about being under the fluorescent lights all day, started to develop a hue so pale that I could pass for an anemic vampire. My coworkers nicknamed me Suki, after a character on that show. Never mind that Suki was technically a fairy or something. We also started lovingly referring to our office corner as The Pit, on account of darkness. Then it wasn't long until we christened our office Hell, and Greg - the demon overlord. Jess joked that the next time he reprimands her for taking too long before answering a call, she'd sprinkle holy water on him. We all had a good laugh at that. <newline> "Who knew all that research on the Greek Orthodox prayers I've been doing would come in handy?" I thought to myself, walking to the water fountain. The short but elaborate prayer and a cross sign routine I did over the unsuspecting piece of equipment had some of my friends laughing so hard, we got confused stares from the rest of the people in the break room. Then back to The Pit we went, lest we attract the wrath of Greg's software. <newline> I was in the middle of explaining to Mrs. Whatshername how very sorry I was that her tank top was not the right size, when I heard a horrible scream. It sounded like a wounded bear, and the smell of rotten eggs coming from the break room was worse than anything I've ever smelled in my life. And I shared a room with my bro when he played hockey, so that's saying something. By the time I finished apologizing, got off the phone, and made my way to the break room, the god-awful smell seemed to have dissipated. There was a crowd of girls gathered around the water fountain, whispering and pointing at something. "I swear, he was just there!" I heard someone say, followed by a fearful "What the hell is that thing?" and a squeaky "It's so ugly it's kind of cute!" <newline> Unable to contain my curiosity any longer, I applied some strategically placed elbows, and got to the front of the mob. Only to see a sparkly magenta-colored lizard the size of a Rottweiler staring up at me with huge yellow eyes from what appeared to be ashes. Through Greg's glasses.
Aurther didn't know how to react. <newline> His wife strode in through the back door and walked into the kitchen like a stranger in her own home. She caught his eye and froze in place breathlessly. Aurther looked up from his newspaper in the evening glow pouring in through the kitchen window as he sat at the table. <newline> He lowered his paper and stood, "Sarah Honey, your work called me today and said that you didn't show up. I couldn't get a hold of you all day long either. I even called the police." <newline> Before he could continue, Sarah strode to Aurther with tears rolling down her face and took him into a tight embrace, sobs wracked her body with her face buried into her husband's shoulder. Her hold on him was strong and Aurther felt himself matching her intensity. He rubbed her back within his embrace to comfort his wife, unable to understand his wife's mood and reaction to coming home. <newline> Sarah loosened her hug to look upon her husband's face, "I never thought I would see your face again." Her hand brushed his cheek and she pulled him in tightly for a passionate kiss, the like he hadn't felt since the beginning of their relationship when their intimate fires burned brightest. She pulled away at arms length and looked her husband up and down in disbelief once more with a beaming smile upon her face. <newline> Aurther was glad for the false alarm but he didn't know what to make of his wife's behaviour and now that he thought about it, he had only now noticed his wife's strange attire and appearance. She wore a sleeveless leather tunic padded with armour, and armoured bracers. A thick leather belt banded around her waist sported a short sword hanging from one side and long dagger hanging on the other side. Her pants were leather padded armour that met her knee high greaves fastened to her boots. Her once well maintained hair was now more of a tangled nest that gathered into a single pony tail where a shock of messy hair hung down to her lower back. Even her body looked different, she looked stronger and more capable physically. <newline> And there was something else... <newline> Something that was written upon her face that spoke of a harrowing experience. Her face was different, aside from a long scar that ran down her face to her chin. He didn't understand it but her deep gaze had a story to tell behind the curtain of her elated expression. <newline> "My love," Aurther breathed with his own eyes beginning to shine with moisture, "What happened?" <newline> Sarah's elated expression began to fade as she gently shook her head. She searched long and hard for the best answer to properly convey what had happened, "A lot." A brief laughed escaped her lips before it quickly dissipated. "Everything changed that day when I left for work". <newline> "That was this morning," Aurther added. <newline> Her face brightened briefly as another tear came streaming down her face again, "Yes I suppose it was, wasn't it." She breathed a sigh of relief, "It worked. Thank god it worked. I've been away for so long, my love. You have no idea what I've been through. Words cannot express how happy I am to see your face again." <newline> Aurther took in his wife's presence as his hand brushed her arms, "Sarah I don't understand." <newline> "There was a lot that I didn't understand at first either. It took a long time for me to adapt to my new reality. But I never gave up hope. I had to find my way back home and I did whatever it took." His screwed face was frozen in time in wait for further elaboration, "Ok, let me start from the beginning." <newline> Aurther just sat there with the same thousand yard stare that she must have had when everything had changed that day, this day. Hours later and a large pizza nearly devoured and Aurther was starting to come to terms with the information that he had just taken in. Sarah helped herself to a few more bread sticks and her seventh slice of pizza. <newline> He shifted in his seat and took in a deep breath, "So, in this land of uh...Solaria, where you spent what you think was around three and a half years, became a skilled warrior, and embarked on this epic journey that ultimately led you back to your home realm," Aurther had to pause to absorb the absurdity of his own words, "How did you do it all? I mean, how did my book loving, Pinterest scrolling, nurse wife become who you are now? What was that creature that you slew in the Hollow Marshes, a Basketlisk?" <newline> "Basilisk," she corrected. <newline> "A Basilisk, yes. How?" <newline> Sarah wiped her mouth on her arm, "Well, I don't know if I can explain it. I think it was something deep inside that was always there. Something waiting to awaken. The life that I took on came so naturally." <newline> Aurther looked deeply for a moment almost too embarrassed for his thought "Forgive my insecurity...but did anything ever happen between you and this Theron?" <newline> "What? Goodness no! He was my most trusted companion and a skilled warrior, if not for him then I would have been dead many times over. There is a strong bond between the people who watch your back, who you trust your life with. We were close because of that alone, there was no intimacy shared. Well, there was that one time he drunkenly confessed his undying love for me." <newline> "Wait what? I didn't hear that part of the story over the past several hours." <newline> "That didn't seem like an important detail, Aurther. Honestly, I just recounted a myriad of events that I've been through involving war, dungeons, labyrinths, impossible floating land masses, dragons, and an evil wizard to name a few and your take away detail was whether or not there was a 'thing' between me and one of my companions?" a faint annoyance found it's way into Sarah's demeanour. <newline> Aurther hung his head ashamed, "I'm sorry. You're right honey. I trust you completely, it was just a moment of insecurity I suppose." They shared a long look, "You must be exhausted. Why don't we go to bed and continue this tomorrow? I'm just glad to have you back." <newline> Sarah took her time through the house like she was walking through an ancient ruin forgotten to time. She brushed through her clothes within their drawers, ran her hand along the mattress, played with the bathroom taps, studied a red heel from the closet that belonged to a woman from a different life. <newline> Aurther fell asleep first, he was snoring hard and fast next to her. Sarah laid awake staring at the ceiling. Even after everything she had been through and that final harrowing escape, she should be exhausted but sleep could not find it's way to her mind. Sarah tossed and turned in this unfamiliar bed, far more comfy than the accommodations she had become accustomed to on her journey's. She couldn't sleep because she didn't understand why? <newline> She had finally accomplished what she had set out to do all of those years ago. She found her way back home after being away for so long in a foreign and strange realm. She ate a large pizza and she was laying in her own bed next to her husband in her own home for the first time in what felt like a lifetime. This was it, this is what she fought so hard for all of this time. <newline> So why wasn't she happy? <newline> Where accomplishment and happiness should be, there was only emptiness, a yearning. She looked over to her husband and watched his chest rise and fall. She looked out to the moon through the bedroom window, the branches swaying softly in the night wind. She stood and went to the window staring at the black expanse dotted with bright stars. <newline> "Even the stars are different..." She watched the few clouds in the night sky float by the bright moon. Her grip became tight on the window ledge. Sarah looked to her husband sleeping soundly in his bed and back to the night sky as she produced a small charm attached to a red feather from within her hair. She held it in her cupped hand, a large sigh escaped her lips involuntarily and she fought back a tear. "...They need me," she looked up to the moon, "I can help them win this war. Solaria will not fall while I live and breath." <newline> Sarah clutched her charm close to her chest before donning her armour and weapons once more. She penned a note to her husband and left it on her pillow. For what it was worth, she truly was sorry that she had to do this. But she had to. He wouldn't understand.
Cecilia was as quiet as usual in the car ride to the beach. It was summer break, and like every year since I’d taken her in, we were going down to my wife’s old beach home. I could still remember the frantic little motions she’d made towards the blue horizon, driving past it just after making the decision to adopt her. <newline> Aria sprang to action. “You like the beach, Cecilia?” At this, the infant gesticulated all the more violently towards the sands. We took a little detour, and ended up spending the next hour in attire and weather neither too appropriate for the beach running around after the little one. The memory was bittersweet. <newline> “Carl? You remember Carl. I told you about him last week. Ol’ Carl, we been drinking buddies since our early twenties. Our pops were drinking buddies, and so were their pops. So anyway, Carl, yesterday at work, comes into the office dressed up like a surfer, could you believe?” I rambled on and on, as I always did when alone with Cecilia. She seemed unusually quiet today, and that’s saying something, considering she was always quiet. Soon enough, I had run down all the threads I could of monologuing. The traffic was heavy. <newline> I drummed my fingers on the wheel at a red light. Ten seconds passed. Twenty. Another three, and it hit green. A hunk of a sixteen wheeler took its sweet time starting up again. <newline> “Why’d momma have to die?” <newline> I almost jumped out of my skin. I did jump in my seat, and my hands jerked on the wheel. I took a seventy degree turn by accident, and almost caused one. I stopped right in the middle of the street, and looked over at Cecilia. <newline> Backdropped by a baker’s dozen of honking and beeping horns, twin tears streaked down her face. <newline> “Why’d momma have to die?” <newline> Her loud crying filled the space, and for the first time since I’d met her, I was the quiet one.
I wake up, shower, get dressed, and start my walk to work in a daze. Six months of working a 40 - 60 hour work week in hell, then having to go work another 20+ hours washing dishes had started to take it's toll on me. Of course the paycut hadn't really affected the upper tier demons, they all had tenure. I clock in and start my day of torture. <newline> 14 hours today. I like flaying the skin off of the wicked over and over as much as the next guy, but seriously!? 14 hours!? I'm running back to my place as quickly as I can. No time for a shower. I change and sprint to the portal. My heart sinks as I notice Azazel has monopolized it. I look at my watch. 30 minutes. I look around quickly then push my way through the crowd. I hold my hand up high and yell, "AZAZEL!" <newline> I'm nearly out of breath. "My apologies for my lateness" I keep my eyes on the floor. I hope this works <newline> "What are you doing here?", He asks in a very annoyed tone. <newline> I finally look up at him, "Routine possession..." I say as if I'm reminding him. "I signed up over a week ago", Without looking at his paperwork he waves me through, still looking as if he would rather tear my head off. <newline> Out of breath and covered in sweat, I clock in one minute late. My shift doesn't start for another 14 minutes, but Steve insists on everyone being 15 minutes early at least. Steve was a mid twenties college drop out, that had gotten lucky when his dad opened this place and let him run it. <newline> Run it into the ground was more like it, but I didn't care as long as I got paid. I'm heading to the dish room when I hear, "Hello Nicholas." I hated that voice. So full of smugness and self importance. <newline> "What is it Steve?" I try to sound polite. <newline> "You're late", cue evil smile/sneer, "That's and hour of pay docked" <newline> My eyes go wide and I know there are flames dancing in them. "It was one minute! My shift doesn't even start until 8!" <newline> He never broke eye contact. "You could go find another job if you prefer..." <newline> As I step closer, I feel a hand on my shoulder. I look back and see one of the cooks. An older man with bright blue eyes. He was the only person I really talked to here. And the calming presence told me he was most likely angelic. And if I suspected him, he most likely suspected me. "Pick your battles boy. We both know you need this job" <newline> I back off and storm to my dish room. I can hear Steve yelling at the old man, I never bothered to learn his name, telling him the next time he interrupted him, that he'd fire him. I put my head down and get to work. <newline> I clock out and step outside. Lighting a cigarette, I see the old man and wave. He waves back and disappears down an alley. I head home and go to sleep. <newline> I wake up, shower, get dressed, and head to work in a daze. I open the door to my torture chamber. It's empty. I ask the young lady at the front desk where my ward has gone. "He's been reassigned. You're new ward should be here in abo- oh! Here he is" <newline> I look to where she's looking, and smile. I hold the door to my chamber open for the guards then close it once they're gone. I walk over and lean on his shoulder, adding my weight to his. I know the shackles holding him up are cutting into his hands and wrists. I soak in his confused and terrified look for a few minutes before I speak. <newline> "I'm afraid you're a minute late. And that just won't do Steven."
I used to push the thoughts away at any cost. As a child I would count the signposts on the way to school every day, tap the doorknob every time I passed by it, or press my fingers against my eyelids until I could feel it all evaporating into colorful silence. As I grew up, it became more internal. Everyday was a battle inside my own head, as I pushed the thoughts away, repeating over and over, *I would never do that*. <newline> I was in college when I booked my first therapy appointment, when the shame was finally outweighed by the genuine fear that I was going crazy. I will never forget the mix of relief and panic that washed over me I first heard the phrase, “obsessive-compulsive disorder. <newline> ”It was hard at first. It’s hard to break out of a pattern you’ve been following for your whole life, and I felt like I was failing the one hope I had left to break free. My first breakthrough moment came when my therapist described a metaphor: “fighting your thoughts is like a tug-of-war battle inside of your head. The harder you pull, the harder they pull back. You need to find a way to learn to drop the rope.” <newline> Drop the rope, drop the rope. I repeated the phrase to myself all throughout the longest nights, and slowly, I could feel the figurative monster inside my head releasing its grip. <newline> So when it became a literal one, I knew I had been practicing for this moment all my life. <newline> “Kill him. Get a knife and do it.” I can’t help but be a little alarmed. This feels realer than the intrusive thoughts usually do, and I feel the ancient urge to fight them creeping up inside of me. <newline> I take a deep breath and stare the voice down right into its metaphorical eye, refusing to flinch or raise up my fists. Refusing to press my eyes into my head. Just staring, and breathing. <newline> “Wh- what the fuck?” I hear it stutter. “It works, it always works. They cower and panic, try to fight back to no avail, until I’m in control.” <newline> “Just because you can’t murder people as a ghost, doesn’t mean you can torment them either. Try as you might, but I know you can’t hurt me. <newline> ”The voice stares silently for several minutes. I keep breathing and keep my fists relaxed by my sides. Slowly, it begins to flicker, until it finally fades into the gentle backseat of my thoughts. Not gone, never gone, but I know I'm the one in control.
Blinding white light. An electric hum surrounded my body as I was lifted from my backyard. I remember large indistinct figures looming over me in a blindingly white room. I was scared. That passed. <newline> That was a long time ago, maybe 8 months? Maybe longer. It's difficult to tell. My new 'family' isn't so strange to me anymore. Sure, they're about 20 feet tall with smooth grayish-blue skin, but they're... nice. Kind. And they smell almost like mangoes- it's a natural scent they emit. I've adjusted to their massive home, I get my own room, bigger than my old apartment. Also they have this great technology- I just walk into their 'kitchen' and walk into what to me is a massive arch. and immediately whatever foods I want appear before me, perfectly portioned and amazingly made. <newline> The youngest child, Voltida, has taken a special liking to me. She likes to stroke my hair before bed and listen to my 'purring'. She's named me "Spots" after my freckles. She likes to talk to me and dress me up, almost like a Barbie. Last week she had me do a fashion show- she made the clothes herself. They actually look great on me and were very soft, she made them carefully and lovingly. I watched her work on them over many days- hunched over a magnifying glass with a needle in hand, sometimes having me touch the fabric. Cooing admiringly when I tried on each finished piece. We were happy. But the fun had to be interrupted by the oldest child. <newline> Drinzela, from what I can tell, is a teenager. My earliest understanding of her age came when she pierced her "florca"- the Vinderian equivalent of a nose. She rolled her eyes as her parents scolded her. One day she gave me a necklace of sorts, one that matched her own. At first I thought nothing of it until I realized she would watch me intently any time we were in the same room. From then on, I could understand them. All of them. And she could understand me. <newline> Which brings us to our current problem. Drinzela has discovered that I'm sentient. So here we sit, in the equivalent of the living room. She's going on and on about how it isn't right to keep me here. How I should be returned to "my people". Voltida has tears in her eyes. The parents are looking on with sympathy. The father speaks. <newline> "Well, Drinzela makes a good point. If we keep Spots, we're keeping her from her family, friends, and life on her home world. That is ethically wrong." <newline> Voltida cries out, hugging me close. I have tears in my eyes, too. <newline> "No! She's my best friend, you can't take her. You can't!" <newline> "Come on, Voltida. It isn't right to hold someone here when they belong somewhere else" Drinzela huffs. <newline> She's so self-righteous I want to smack her. Then it dawns on me. I point to my necklace, and to Drinzela's. All members seem to understand my request. They plug Drinzela's necklace into a device that looks like a speaker. Then they all look at me. Oh, right. My turn to speak. <newline> "Uh, hi," I begin. They gasp, exchanging glances. I continue. <newline> "I like it here. The food is better than anything I get at home. I don't have to work a job I hate. Voltida really loves me. I love her too. Please, don't make me leave." <newline> Silence hangs in the air for a moment. Drinzela lets out an exasperated sigh. Voltida grins. The mother speaks up at last. <newline> "Fortendor, I think we should let her stay. It seems to be what she wants." <newline> "Fine, but if she gets too expensive or messy, we're taking her right back to where we found her!" <newline> I haven't stopped smiling since.
'Shit!' Vryntinkal the Touretted yelled <newline> 'I agree with our comrade here' Ivan said picking at his rusty ax 'A dragon that can do magic is like a hooker that can tell a joke... we will all be done in seconds' <newline> 'I find it very sexist that you are assuming that just because she is an evil sorceress that she is a woman' Helen of Yort said slapping Ivan in the face. <newline> 'What if its just a dragon' Bob asked putting down his Nokia cell phone 'I would be uncomfortable killing such a creature' <newline> Yoris chuckled 'What's the difference between a a sorceress and a dragon' <newline> 'What?' the redfaced Ivan asked sensing a joke <newline> 'I can keep dragon my balls across your face' <newline> Helen appeared from out of nowhere and dished out another slap. <newline> 'Now is no the time for games' Reeemus 5000 said through his transponder 'We currently have a 34.6% success rate' <newline> 'I agree with the robot,' Enchilada the Minatour whispered 'we must focus on our tactics on how to bring this Princess back safely' <newline> 'How do we know that the princess can't turn into a dragon?' Bob asked <newline> Yoris chuckled 'What's the difference between a sorceress and a dragon' <newline> 'What?' Asked Ivan bemused <newline> 'I have Dementia' <newline> A silence settled on the camp. <newline> 'Look guys I don't know about you but I have a theory' said Herbim the blind 'Maybe there is no quest' <newline> Bozum the invisible interjected 'It is clear that after all we have been through from the siege of the Silver Mines of Pam to the Great Hunt of Bazul Kroo, to Enchilada's wedding, that this is the most challenging quest we have undertaken' <newline> 'Now Yoris, you read the pamphlet that the King gave you about the princess, what did it say?' asked Ulloa the Ghost <newline> 'I have dementia' Yoris said with confidence <newline> 'I thought you were dyslexic?' Ivan asked <newline> 'Maybe her biggest spell is not breathing fire or shifting shapes but ambiguity itself' pondered Eze the 1 foot Giant. <newline> 'Look I'm a sorceress that can turn into a Dragon, I've got the Princess up on that hill there, you guys are taking far to long to find me and commence battle. I'm getting very bored' said some lady <newline> 'Shit!' Vryntinkal the Touretted yelled <newline> 'I have dementia' Yoris said <newline> 'Listen stranger we have no quarrel with you be gone. We are warriors on a quest' Demanded Ikor the headless. <newline> 'Jesus Christ' The random Lady said frustratingly before wondering away. <newline> 'Yes I am here too' said Jesus of Nazareth <newline> 'Now what if she is a woman who can turn into neither a sorcerress or a Dragon?' Mughai the Diabetic asked. <newline> 'All I know is we have a long night of debate ahead of us' said the Princess <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline> &amp;#x200B; <newline>
