        "story": "Let me tell you something son, that little war was supposed to be a simple show of dominance. It happened a long time ago, back when those... *humans* just started to expand throughout the cosmos as an official navigator species. And if you think that now the humans are outrageous, you should've seen them when they started, for as much as they mock us as brutes, we, the proud Arthorian Golems, were at least indsightful enough to unify our whole civilization under one banner before trying to reach for others beyond our planet. Those madmen haven't even reached a semblance of peace when they begun reaching through space, I remember clearly that even some of their civil conflicts were brought along in their expedition, leaving their few allies caught in up to 5 different battles at once. <newline> The weirdest part was that they didn't even called themselves a warrior race. Those scrawny, molestrush-looking species were developing hundreds of ways of fighting and dueling; their most told tails always involved power, strenght, and courage; they repurposed every little piece of resources they could find into a weapon. Yet, their leaders were, and still are, the smart and the cunning; they always put their bets on diplomacy first as a solution, no matter how fake or ridiculous it sounded; and worst of all, they never took any semblance of honor in their innovations and weapons, they related war with something they called *violence*, a cruel word that painted our pride and joy as needless destruction and death. <newline> Sure, there were humans that didn't share that sentiment, as its a law of nature, but even those that took pride in combat always talked about it with a weird melancholic tone. But son, that aberration for war didn't cause anger in us, but intrigue. After all, even the most pompous of the diplomat races saw value in our methods on ocassion, but those humans were different, they acted as if fighting was a cursed cast among themselves, a contradiction in their nature that they couldn't stop. <newline> The realization came to us not long after our first contact. As its tradition, we welcomed the humans with a declaration of war, a show of strenght and the capabilities of each other, to see if they deserved our comraderie. The humans tried in all possible ways to avoid our challenge as we expected, but we persisted until the humans got no choice but to agree. It all came ahead the day that we agreed would be the start of the war. Our champion at the time, I think his name was Redickson, was still in the middle of our ritual dance of victory when the sky was flooded with ships. It was an entire human fleet, with every little kain of their ships covered in weapons. The commander of the fleet, the now ambassador Santiago Cubillos, started transmiting a message to the whole planet, an eerie speech about their pride as a nation, the nature of sacrifice, with the phrase 'the lenghts to which we'll be willing to go for our safety are as vast as the dark sea we are all floating in' getting ingrained in our people for generations to come, ending with an approaching invasion from the fleet. I personally saw their sub-ships landed, leaving behind what at the time seemed like millions of humans, each one of them as armored as their fleet. <newline> Your grandma, who at the time was one of our few diplomats, almost lost her head scrambling for a way to contact Admiral Cubillos before the humans arrived to any mayor citadel. You see son, the reason the humans hated war was very simple: for to them war held a different meaning, they didn't distinguish between what we know as *Morgáyn* and war, and their stubborness and curiosity didn't give them the privilege to do so."

        "story": "'Drundal of Eldonis, Leo the Valiant, please have a seat.' Holding the door open I welcome the two clients of the evening and smile as I look up to Leo. He returns it with his own brilliance. <newline> “Just Leo is fine dear,” with a gait of grace he walks in and takes a seat on the large couch against the wall. His long wavy hair slowly falling upon his muscular chest as he tries to get comfortable. <newline> *Wow, he’s just as charming as the legends say. To think he would be walking into my office, today, it’s a dream come true.* <newline> Keeping my composure and doing my best not to blush, I look towards Drundal of Elreon. His tall frame matching Leo’s however his build was not as bulky, yet he is still fit judging from the midriff where his crop top ended. <newline> “It’s Adrin,” he says as he walks over to the same couch, but sits on the opposite side of Leo. “it’s the shorthand of Drundal.” <newline> “Right, my apologies.” I say as I straighten my glasses with my left hand and situate myself on a stool in front of the couch. <newline> After going through formalities and small talk I began my work. “So Adrin, when did you notice the emotional distance between you two.” <newline> “A month ago, after the last battle, he just stopped…” his words came to a pause before picking back up, “he stopped wanting my embrace.” His eyes drift to focus elsewhere at a spot in the corner of the room. I could notice that his eyes began to swell. <newline> Speaking up I ask, “And why is that Leo?” <newline> Leo’s chest rose slowly and fell heavily. “During my last battle... I took many hits, I was beaten, and damaged. I did not want to be comforted” <newline> “Why is that? Is there an emotion that you brought back?” <newline> “I felt less of a man, less of a warrior.” <newline> Adrin’s eyes set back on Leo, “you aren’t any less of a man.” <newline> Leo growled and shouted, “I am!” <newline> The room then began to shake and rattle with his roar. A few pictures on the wall tilt, unlevel, and again Leo repeats quietly, “I am.” <newline> “Babe…” Adrin slowly attempts to put a hand on Leo’s shoulder, but Leo pushes it away. Adrin’s tears now start to fall and he wipes them away. “I promise, you’re good enough for me.” <newline> “I need to be better!” Leo moves his head to the side looking away from both of us. <newline> “Leo, please.” Adrin says, but to no avail. Leo keeps his gaze away. <newline> I speak up, “Leo, it’s ok to have failures. It’s how you deal with them that is most important.” <newline> His gaze does not unnaffix from the wall. <newline> Easing the stress I change topics, “then tell me, what is your normal routine for post stress relief.” <newline> Leo doesn’t talk for a few seconds, but slowly opens up about the past and what he has done before. A mixture of meditation, hot bath, and simple other forms of self-care. <newline> “And Adrin, he helps you?” <newline> Leo nods. <newline> “Do you appreciate him?” <newline> He nods again. <newline> “How do you show it?” <newline> After asking this question Leo talks more and more and realizes that he has not been showing Adrin the care he needs. After coming to this assumption Leo drops his strong composure and looks over to Adrin. “Adrin, darling. I didn’t know.” <newline> Leo’s eyes began to water and Adrin too began his waterfall of tears. For the first time this session they began to embrace. After holding for a while they brought their lips to each other. Finally pulling away they put on two smiles of compassion, smiles of love. <newline> “I’m sorry,” says Leo. <newline> Adrin nods and embraces again. <newline> After a short while of making up and talking about how to do better in the future they began to thank me for the service before leaving. <newline> *Good couple, they’re cute together. I’m sure they’ll do fine.* <newline> Clearing the fog from my glasses I look to my schedule, *Dusa and Zagreus,* then look to the walls of the crooked pictures. *Well I better clean this up, my day is far from over.* <newline> Thanks for reading. This is my first time writing first person present tense. Feedback is very much appreciated."

I just didn’t have the power to heal. I kept dying plants in my room and tried each day to rejuvenate them with my touch. Nothing ever happened. <newline> I gave my brother John a weak smile and went back to my room in the castle. I did not tell anyone that I could not heal. It was too embarrassing. <newline> On a particularly rainy day, my father’s servant woke me and begged for me to come see him. My father was very ill and they needed a healer to help him. His power would not work in his own body, everyone knew that. <newline> As I took a deep breath and readied myself to go see father, I took one last chance and touched one of the plants in my room. It withered and died. <newline> My face went pale. I was terrified of being thrust into a room with my father and expected to help him with my touch, only to find that I had murdered him as I did to the plant. <newline> “I cannot go,” I finally said to the servant, “I am not a healer.” <newline> The servant did not know how to respond. He just stood there. <newline> “I’m going to have to go see him anyway aren’t I?” <newline> “If it please my lord, I have the task of bringing you to him. I do not know what will happen after you arrive.” <newline> I sighed heavily. <newline> When we arrived in my father’s chambers, I was greeted by hopeful faces filled with relief at my arrival. My brother John was there and had already done what he could to heal our father who now had the strength to sit up in his bed. <newline> I nervously addressed the crowd of family members and well-wishers. <newline> “I am very sorry to say that I do not possess the family gift of healing.” <newline> The murmur of gossip that rang through the crowd of people in front of me was not in any way quiet. <newline> “Surely, you own father’s illness would be enough to cause you to search within yourself for the ability,” Aunt Rheta said. Her haughty eyes and downturned lips directed at my trembling hands. <newline> My father hushed the crowd and looked at me intently. <newline> “My boy, did we not embrace yesterday when I returned home from my travels?” <newline> “Yes, father.” <newline> “I felt a power leave your body and enter mine. If that was not the gift of healing, I do not know what it could be.” <newline> It all made sense to me. I looked up at him with mournful eyes. <newline> “Father?” <newline> “Yes?” <newline> “Were you ill *before* I touched you?” <newline> “What are you saying, Son?” <newline> “I think that power you felt was not healing, but the opposite. I have withered a plant just today with my touch.” <newline> As everyone in the room stepped back away from me, I felt like a monster. I could not stay in the castle anymore. I ran away and did not look back. <newline> And that is how I ended up here.” <newline> The highway bandits looked at one another in anxious thought. They were all thinking the same thing. If this story was true, they probably shouldn’t rob this man and should just stay far away from him. <newline> Merto spoke up first, “he’s lyin’ froo his teef I tells ya!” <newline> The bandits closed in on the well dressed man. He gave a great sigh and removed his gloves. <newline> Before long, the man was walking down the road, just as he was before, only now there were five rotting corpses left behind him."

Look up, he’s waiting to drop onto you.” Meowth the orange tabby continued to meow at their owner, trying to get their attention. No matter how loud they meowed, the owner would only give them a sarcastic roll of the eyes, continuing to browse through various cat memes on their computer. <newline> “I’ll feed you later, Meowth. I just need to send Stacy a feels like a Monday gif. Do you think she would prefer a short, furred cat or something with a more luscious coat like yours? Personally, I think the more luscious coat, but I think that could be misleading. Do you think she would consider that flirting?” Tyler tapped away at his keyboard while the ninja nervously tightened his grip, struggling to maintain a hold on the thin star shaped ornament that covered the lightbulb. <newline> That was it! Meowth didn’t need to draw the human’s attention to the intruder, they only needed to ensure that they lost their grip before he turned around. Meowth wasn’t entirely sure why the ninja hadn’t already attacked. Perhaps they needed to confirm Tyler’s identity before the kill? Or maybe it was just a preference? Regardless, Meowth had an opportunity to rescue the can opener. <newline> “What person would consider that flirting? How does that even mark your scent on her?” Meowth said, letting out a few confused meows before jumping onto his owner’s lap, making sure he stayed seated. <newline> “Right, it would be far too flirty. That’s why I asked. It’s like you just understand me.” Tyler dragged his fingers through Meowth’s fur, the cat letting out a long-satisfied purr before jumping from his lap onto the desk, looking back at the ninja, who now had a few drops of sweat pooling near the holes of his mask. <newline> “You understand nothing I say. I have had more intellectually challenging conversations with that stuffed mouse toy. Why would someone even want to kill you? Did you refuse to open their tuna can?” Meowth let out a laugh, which only translated into a series of strange sneezes. <newline> The ninja readjusted his grip, swinging down temporarily, only to pull himself up at the last moment to regain his position, trying his best not to be caught. It was hard to say what he was more afraid of. Being found out or touching the dust coated carpet that Tyler refused to clean. <newline> “You’re really talkative today, aren’t you snugglebutt? Maybe I should get you a friend? Oh, how about a puppy? I heard some cats get along well with dogs. I think I heard about that on some science show called Catdog or was it Dogcat?” At Tyler’s dumb suggestion, Meowth gave him a whack across the face with his paw, reminding the human who was in charge here. <newline> “Keep talking like that and you’re getting a dead bird under your pillow tomorrow. I still don’t get why you humans don’t consider us giving you dead animals a threat. When is that ever a sign of affection? It’s a threat that you idiots don’t listen to.” Meowth kept his attention on the ninja who only had one hand still curled around the ornament, their fingers slowly slipping one by one, until their pinky was the only thing keeping them up. <newline> “I guess I should feed you. It would be cruel to deny you dinner for too long. What do you want? The super protein chicken fluffy mix or the watery, fun fish mix?” Tyler went to push his chair back, getting closer to the ninja’s reach. <newline> Meowth had to act quickly, jumping onto his owner’s head, using it as a springboard, launching himself at the attacker, delivering a powerful scratch to his leg. The ninja dropped from the ceiling, collapsing onto a bookshelf, leaving a large, human sized dent in the wood. <newline> By the time Tyler had turned around to face the commotion, the ninja was already gone, having retreated from the scene, leaving Meowth sitting by the wreckage, head tilted to the side. “So, are we going to eat dinner now?” They meowed, only getting a wiggling finger from their owner as a response. “That’s not an answer. I just saved your life. Hurry and get me dinner.” <newline> Tyler only laughed, walking out of the room, shaking his head. “What will I ever do with you, Meowth? Maybe I should start buying the low-fat cat food options. You must have put on some weight if you left a dent like that.” He said, going to prepare Meowth’s dinner. <newline> “I hate you so much, human. I hope you and your family are cursed forever with an endless despair that can only rival a fraction of the loathing I feel for you right now. I hope your hands bleed whenever you hold a can of tuna, and the can is covered in rust.” Meowth meowed, already planning their revenge bird plot. <newline> The sound of a shaking can came from the kitchen, followed by the squelch of a mess of food falling from a can, clinging against the metallic bowl below. “Dinner is served.” Tyler shouted as Meowth strutted into the kitchen. <newline> “I guess the despair can hold off for until I’m done eating….” Meowth rubbed his head against the ankle of his owner before finding his bowl, rewarding himself with a well-earned meal. <newline> &nbsp; <newline> &nbsp; <newline> &nbsp; <newline> (If you enjoyed this feel free to check out my subreddit /r/Sadnesslaughs where I'll be posting more of my writing.)"

Alas, I am no Shakespeare. Did you know he’s allergic to dairy? He didn’t. Not until the day I watched him rush to the bathroom after downing a Venti Caramel Macchiato with whole milk. I don’t mean someone dressed as Shakespeare. I mean Mr. “Et tu Brute” himself, frilly neck-thing and all. I guess just saying I’m a barista wasn’t explaining exactly what’s going on here. I’m a barista at a Starbucks in the afterlife. It wasn’t what I planned on doing in death but after my car plowed into the back of a garbage truck at 90 miles an hour, making coffee for the dead seemed like a needed change of pace. I guess it was a “forced” change of pace but either way. <newline> Most days are like a normal human worker at Starbucks. I stock the cups, I clean up the bathrooms, and I make coffee. One day in particular stands out over the rest though. The leaves were beginning to change on the perfectly green trees outside as the cold weather crept in. Here at Starbucks that means one thing, Pumpkin Spiced Lattes. I had heard from my boss, Mr. Bowker, that this time of year was slow as far as regular customers but the brisk morning air brought a particular breed of deados with it. You might call them fantasy writers. I think they’re just messed up in the head. As I wiped down the counter for the one millionth time, I heard the door open and without looking, expelled our required opening line. “Welcome to Starbucks”, I shouted as I continued to wipe. A mousy voice came over the counter. “You’ve gotten that new coffee in, right?” he asked. I looked up to see a driving hat topping off the cutest old man you’ve ever seen. He played with his suspenders nervously as I could see him waiting for an answer. “Yes sir, absolutely.” He let out a laugh that I could have sworn only came from garden gnomes and Bilbo Baggins. “I’ll take three”, he said excitedly holding up his fingers. <newline> I furrowed my brow, “That’s fine sir but you know you can just come back tomorrow and get another one? I can guarantee we won’t sell out.” <newline> There went that laugh again, “No ma’am, no ma’am. I’m meeting a couple friends here.” I rang up his order, explained that death doesn’t excuse you from paying sales tax, and made his coffee. A few moments later, a disheveled looking man with a 40’s era side part eased through the door. “Mr. Orwell,” said the man in the suspenders as he sprung from the leather chair. The man shook his hand and pushed back a piece of hair that had fallen. He opened up in a full tooth grin, “George, it is good to see you, old boy.” <newline> “How was your summer?” asked George. <newline> Mr. Orwell slumped back and took a breath, “Quite alright, actually. I never did care much for sand though. Annoying little bits of coarse rock that get everywhere.” <newline> “You spent too much time with the ‘Other George’ didn’t you?” <newline> Mr. Orwell let out a small laugh, “Indeed I did. Funny little man who seemed quite obsessed with me. He kept calling me an ‘Inspiration’. I thought I’d love having an eternal fan of my work. Now, I’m beginning to think I was wrong in that assumption.” <newline> “You finished that piece you were working on?” <newline> “You’re one to speak on finishing anything, George.” <newline> George groaned as he leaned forward and adjusted his hat. “You’re not wrong”, he said before releasing another laugh. <newline> After sharing in the laugh for a few moments Mr. Orwell sighed, “No I kid you, old boy but yes I did indeed finish it.” <newline> George moved his hand in a “let’s see it” motion. Mr. Orwell reached in the leather bag he’d carried in and produced a stack of typewriter paper. George looked confused. “1985?” he asked, “That’s what you’re going with?” <newline> “Yes, you see they break out of 101 and stage a revolt. It’s going to be a hit with the newly deceased.” Mr. Orwell squirmed for a moment before exclaiming, “You think you can do any better? I’m sorry there’s no tits or arse in it for you.” <newline> “I’m telling you that’s what sells the damn thing”, replied George. “Haven’t you ever heard ‘sex sales’?” The door opened again and again I expelled our greeting. A red flash darted to the leather seats. The man bowed his head and cupped his hands. George and Mr. Orwell bowed back awkwardly. After a few greetings and George passing out the coffee they looked around. The man in red seemed uncomfortable. “A walk then gents?” asked Mr. Orwell. “I was just going to suggest that”, replied George. As the three walked out I heard the man in red ask, “We see Vita now?” George shut the door to my shop, “I told you she doesn’t want to see you Dante.”"

Ignorant, pig-headed, misogynistic. <newline> Selfish. <newline> That's really what it came down to; selfishness. These men wanted to see more of my so-called beauty because it gave them pleasure. They assumed I wore my head covered as some sort of slight *to them*. <newline> I wore my head covered because Poseidon had coveted my beauty- not so differently to what they were doing now- and it made me a victim. <newline> The snakes that came later... I don't know. Some kind of magical protection. Perhaps a gift from Athena, the goddess I had served. Perhaps an apology, for not protecting me. <newline> Constraining my snakes was painful. Each of them had a vibrant personality, and loved to move freely- but whenever they heard the aggressive thoughts of others, they would writhe madly- and that was painful, too. <newline> A cycle of pain- just hurt, all around me- because one man-- no, one god- coveted that which he did not have. <newline> I was used to the stares and the echoes of lascivious thoughts bouncing around in men's heads. It was accompanied by the writhing of my snakes, so I could practically hear it- imagine it, and likely with great accuracy. <newline> Until, suddenly...my snakes relaxed. The painful writhing stopped. <newline> I looked around, wildly- had everyone left this crowded plaza? Usually my snakes were only calm when I was alone- <newline> No. They had felt the peace and strength radiating from one nearby, and they were reacting to it. <newline> Sitting at a cafe, a young woman sipped on coffee- her face was serene, her eyes were closed- perhaps she was in a rapturous moment. <newline> Curious, I sat across from her. 'That must be excellent coffee. What did you get?' <newline> 'No, the coffee is...mediocre. It was your presence, actually.' She opened her eyes- both of which were clouded. <newline> My jaw dropped- like something out of a silly movie. <newline> She continued. 'I am unable to see- but there are many things that I may *feel*. Your energy is...so inspiring. You wade through lakes and oceans of pain, yet you don't seem to muster up hate for your fellow humans.' <newline> 'You're wrong.' I said, stiffly. 'I do hate them.' <newline> 'If that were true,' She said softly, 'You would allow your snakes to be free, and they would turn everyone in this city to stone.' <newline> 'H-how did you-' <newline> 'They are speaking with me. I can feel their intentions- they want to protect you, so desperately. Every tumultuous thought that they hear, they want to lash out in anger. You don't let them- because you don't *really* hate them. You are afraid, and perhaps resentful- but you refuse to give yourself over to hate. That is...incredible strength. I am honored to be in your presence.' <newline> Tears stung my eyes. 'Who are you?' <newline> 'I am called Arachne.' <newline> '...Medusa.'"

        "story": "How long had it really been? Existing in the void, I had no way of knowing how long I had stopped time for. All clocks ceased to work, every living being frozen in time. Except for me. I’ve had this gift for as long as I can remember, I can only guess I was born with it. You would think someone born with the ability to stop time would be excellent with time management, right? For me, it seems I was born with an extraordinary talent of procrastination as well. <newline> It started out innocently enough. I would stop time to finish an essay right before the deadline after I had wasted the time allocated on playing video games or binge-watching Netflix. Occasionally I’d stop it to get ready to see friends after spending the day browsing through Reddit for far too long. But the more and more I did it, the longer I stayed in the void. Hours on hours. Everything stopped. Time literally did not exist in the void. I was free to do whatever I pleased for as long as I pleased. Was it healthy? Probably not, but who was here to say otherwise. No one except for me knew about the void space or my abilities. <newline> This had definitely been the longest I’d spent here. Had it been days? Weeks? Months? There was no way of knowing. It felt like I could spend forever in here, almost not wanting to go back to reality. I could have been using this time productively. Learning another language, honing my piano skills, anything. Instead, I had played from start to finish The Witcher 1, 2 and 3, and I had just delved into Bioshock. I had finished The Office, Parks and Recs, Shameless, Stranger Things, The Haunting of Hill House, Black Mirror and Orange is the New Black. I was also starting to run out of Stephen King novels to read. <newline> It was like a compulsion. An addiction almost. Once I had started, I couldn’t stop. I told myself repeatedly I could go back whenever I wanted. I sometimes wondered if I had forgotten how to return to reality. Physically I could. But mentally, I was having second thoughts. So much of my time had passed, but for my friends, my family, the whole world. Everything was at a standstill. Things I knew about my life were fading from my memory. Would I even remember what was going on? Current world events? What my friends were doing with their lives? I had even started to forget why I had stopped time in the first place. <newline> Maybe it would be better if I just didn’t go back. I could start a new life in the void. Get started on all those things I had been putting on. Finally get my life back on track. Start eating healthily and working out. Travel the world. Finish my bucket list. I started listing all the things I wanted to accomplish in my life before it dawned on me. I wasn’t really living my life, not here in the void space. This was not reality. In the void, I could not accomplish these things. I had to return to my reality. <newline> I take a final moment, before I unfreeze time, to gather my thoughts. I allow myself to remember why I had stopped time. It all starts to fall into place, piece by piece. Bracing myself, I make the trek to the last place I was. I enter the large sliding doors and am confronted with the bright lights and strong smell of cleaning fluids, chemicals, and sickness. The unusual quietness is confronting. Doctors, nurses and patients alike, perfectly still. Unbeknownst to them, their entire lives completely on hold. <newline> The elevators are all still frozen, so I scale the stairs to the upper levels. Unable to ask anyone for help, I search through the rooms before I finally find the one I’m looking for. I’ve been procrastinating for so long, it’s tempting to stay here for a little while longer. But I must find my strength. I focus my mind on why I’m here. <newline> Entering, the whiteness of the room and loud, mechanical noises are a shock to my system. But even more shocking is the figure in the bed. Smaller than I remember, huddled underneath the blankets, I have a passing thought that maybe I’m too late. But the monitors are still beeping. <newline> I take a deep breath and step forward. <newline> “Hi, Mum,' <newline> Her eyes flutter open, hand wanting to reach out. She manages a meek two words. <newline> “My baby...” she trails off. <newline> I can tell she’s weak. Her battle has been a long and hard one. <newline> “I came to say goodbye.”"

He was definately not of Kingly presence, but commanded attention nonetheless. 'You all are brought here with your wares, each a simple sword, or what remains of your attempts.

She always woke three minutes before the alarm, and then protested for the next twenty minutes about how the world was cold and cruel and she didn’t want to face it, before finally relenting and starting her day. It was a routine that had started when she was six and at eleven years old showed no signs of changing. She wasn’t terribly bearable until after a shower, when she’d relent to what ever breakfast her mother managed to scrounge together during their morning dance of getting ready for school and work. <newline> “Make good choices!” her mother called out with only a touch of irony as the girl ducked out the front door and started the perilous journey to school. Okay, it was just a couple blocks to the bus stop, and she’d made the trek by herself for years, but at her core was healthy bit of theater and so the journey had evolved over the years. <newline> She’d been slow to talk, not because she didn’t understand words, and not because she didn’t have things to say, it was just a door that seemed slow to open for her. Until they got their cat, Mr. Fluffer McBiteBite, who’d walk her to the bus stop since he was hold enough to be let out, and like clockwork picked her up after. She’d named him, and had talked to him for years, about everything, no doubt making his long ears grow tired. <newline> Her life was a series of routines, which is why **He** knew that when she got off the bus it’d be at least two hours until her mom got home. It was the perfect moment, one he’d been daydreaming about for well over a month, before he began working through the mental hoops of translating that dream to a reality. He’d even prepared himself for the very real possibility her…. guard cat?... Might attack him, but he wasn’t terribly worried about that. <newline> And so as she left the bus and turned the corner that would lead to her home but take her out of casual view, he slowly slunk along behind her, his car nearby, he closed the distance between them and in one sharp swoop an arm wrapped around her waist, and the hand on the other around her mouth. <newline> He’d been prepared for the cat, which was far more vicious than he could have imagined, launching itself at his face, as if determined to take an eye in the assault. He hadn’t been prepared for the tree, Fangorn, who she’d named after reading *The Lord of Rings*, that swept down like it was bent by a mighty storm to wrap around his legs and yank. As he crashed to the earth, the girl tumbled free and scurried back to watch cat and tree send the man through his paces, one holding him, as the other clawed over every bit of exposed flesh. <newline> She watched with wonder, as the magic she’d always hoped for blossomed into life. She however was not prepared for the bus…Ratha, her mighty chariot that carried her to and fro. Of course it hadn’t always been the same school bus, which didn’t much matter, because every time she’d walked up the stairs, and her hand touched the railing onto the bus, she’d murmured the name with the reverence of a child. <newline> Not only was she not prepared for the bus neither was **he**. However the royal guard seemed to be. The tree and cat worked in tandem, seeming to understand the intent of Ratha, the mighty bus, and Mr. Fluffer McBiteBite drew back in a guard position. Fangorn, the mightiest of suburban trees however lifted the villain, and tossed him into the road for the bus to strike, to the horror of the driver who clutched her chest. <newline> The girls stop, being the last stop there were no children to pay witness to the man making the most visceral splat sound, the driver having a heart attack, or the tree that gave a leafy pet to the girl’s hair before returning to it’s statuesque pose while she was ushered home by her furry companion. <newline> “Mom is never going to believe this….” She murmured, even though that didn’t stop her from animatedly trying to tell the story over and over that night to her mom who was distracted by the evening news that was reporting that numerous school buses that had seemingly malfunctioned and were being taken out of service for an inspection. <newline> She’d always known the world was filled with wonder, and though it’d be years before she understood her part in it, she knew her life would never be the same again…"

After the 'heroes' formed their little band and started their crackdown on the crime, it was becoming extremely difficult to cause the mayhem I so craved.

My partner had also stolen the copies of the original report. We needed all the information, ever minute detail possible to bring our plan to fruition. The other board consisted complicated calculation which were well above my intelligence. The speedster had mathematical proof as he told me that the amount of tachyons we had were enough for us to make the journey to and fro in the past and land at the exact spot and point in time. 'Tomorrow we change the world my friend', the speedster said. 'Yeah', I said lost in thought. <newline> 'Friend' was a little far-fetched.

When he had presented the cylinder to me a week ago and told me that we could travel back in time, I immediately jumped on the idea to murder Him in his sleep when he was just a baby. <newline> 'What? That's fucking diabolical', the speedster had said when I told him, 'and quite basic to be honest. Lacks ingenuity. Violence in his past led to his rise to power. What if we stop it by removing the violence altogether?' I loved how messed up his plan was. Changing the one moment in His life that caused him to become a hero and turning him into a something completely opposite. <newline> 'You ready?', he asked. 'Lets do this', I replied with a mad smile on my face. My entire body was inside a makeshift cast that he assured would allow huge acceleration without crushing it. 'Alright here we go.' <newline> Everything around me was suddenly a blur of colors. The acceleration was threatening to break my body, I closed my eyes and held my breath. I was about to pass out when suddenly everything stopped. I dropped to the ground. Hot bile poured out of my mouth. Suddenly a shot rang near me and I hear a thud. Dazed I turned round and saw a body on the ground. My vision was still blurry but I could make out the yellow suit. 'What the -?', I was all I said before something heavy struck the side of my head and I passed out. <newline> I didn't know how much time had passed when I finally came to. I had a massive headache. I tasted blood in my mouth. I tried to rub my bruised head but was unable to do so because my hands were cuffed. I was currently on an emergency exit stairs of a building overlooking a dark alley. I blinked my eyes and tried to make sense of what had happened. I looked around but could not see the person who had struck me. <newline> I focused on the alley trying to figure out where I was. My head was still groggy when I head voices coming from below. I craned my neck to see who it was. I could see two figures.. no three, the last was smaller than the other two. They were talking but I could not hear anything. They walked a few steps when another figure stepped into the alley from behind the garbage bin. The tallest of the three figures spoke something and stood in front of the other two. There was a scuffle and I heard a loud report of a pistol firing. A woman screamed and then another shot. <newline> The person who had shot the gun then simply walked deeper into the alley. It stopped under the light at the very end of the alley and turned around. The man looked up, directly at me. And then I heard it, it was soft at first but then its volume rose. The cackle of maniacal laughter. The man's entire body shook as he laughed. I watched in horror as my body froze. The sunken eyes and the white hair were misleading, but the deep scars from the glasgow smile were still there, the purple of the dirty suit and the hair raising laughter burned into my vision."

'You mean, like, urban vampires, kind of thing?' <newline> Vampire? No such things as vampires, if they were around at all then people would have heard of them. <newline> 'That kind of thing, yes,' says the... it looks like a telephone? Just a telephone, floating in midair. Not moving. <newline> 'Hmmm. The dystopian theme *is* neat,' he considers. 'Quiet. Restful. Good for a vacation, which is what I was really going for here.' <newline> 'It doesn't get a bit repetitive?' asks the telephone. <newline> 'Eh, I like routine,' shrugs the room mate. 'And it's good for my recovery. But, now that you mention it... ah... a little bit of a twist *would* be pleasant.' <newline> 'Yes!' agrees the telephone. 'A little bit more variety in your life, to keep you thinking, keep your mind nimble. It could be exactly what you need to help speed up your recovery!' <newline> 'Speed up?' he asks, raising an eyebrow. 'Am I recovering to slowly?' <newline> 'Ah.... no,' says the phone. 'No, you're not. We, uh... we don't want you *too* used to one routine when you get back into the real world. You'd need to break habits, and... well, you know where that can lead, heh.' <newline> '*Can* lead, yes. Not *will* lead.' He sighs. 'Alright, a *few* fantasy themes. Just to keep me on my toes. But nothing overt, right?' <newline> 'Nothing overt,' agrees the telephone. And I... I feel funny for a moment. <newline> Have I changed? Am I different? I run my tongue over my teeth; no, my fangs are still there, sharp and pointy. I'd left my sunblock back in the apartment - good thing that today had been completely overcast, letting the sunlight burn my sensitive vampire flesh would have stung like anything. Of course, I had to hide my nature from the people around me, including my roommate, so I made sure that my teeth were not visible as I returned to our shared apartment..."
