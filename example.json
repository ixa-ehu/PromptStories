There had always been an innate understanding within me of my purpose within the larger scheme of things. My fortress within the icy northern mountains had meant my every need, just as the Elder Gods had promised. In return, I was only required to slay heroes when they arrived.\nThat task was blessedly simple for the longest of times. The layout of the fortress was perfect to dispatch unfamiliar intruders. Most heroes died within moments of entry, cut to pieces by my loyal (and easily replaceable) guards. It was always rather thrilling when one navigated the entirety of the complex fortress and reached my throne room. Of course, by that time, they were near death and carried only minimum supplies.\nI’m not quite sure how long I resided within the frozen stone fortress – decades, centuries, a millennium perhaps. Time was meaningless.\nThen, I nearly died.\nThe fight had seemed akin to any other, a valiant yet battered hero with broken armor and a chipped blade. It was nothing I hadn’t seen a hundred times before. But there had been something different about this warrior – no matter what I tried; the man had survived.\nIt was only as I stared at my own broken blade, that I realized my demise was imminent. In that moment, a strange sensation came over me, something I now realize was fear. I collapsed a section of the throne room with the last of my mana and fled. Donning a simple black cloak, I boarded a departing supply ship at the harbor and left the fortress behind.\nI wandered the vast continent for years, fleeing at the mere sight of any hero. Eventually I convinced myself that the Elder Gods would not punish me for abandoning my post and settled down in a nameless town, marrying a wonderful woman and fathering two children. I found steady work at the lumber yard, supplying logs for the massive hero-funded cities growing along the coast.\nFor a while, life was uneventful. Then, the game found me once again.\n“Ben,” the foreman whistled. “Get over here.”\nWiping my brow, I buried my axe into the trunk before me and made my way to the burly, bearded man standing in the shadows of the endless forest with an oddly-dressed stranger.\n“Something wrong?” I asked innocently enough.\n“Nothing wrong,” the foreman replied bluntly. “Got a new hire. Name’s Joel. Came down from one of the cities up north to…” The bearded man turned to the stranger for elaboration.\n“To reconnect with nature,” the man known as Joel said. He spoke in a peculiar tone, his dark eyes staring directly at me. “Foreman said that you’d show me the ropes.”\nI raised my brow in question. “No offense, foreman. I ain’t paid to teach.”\nThe muscular man nodded and extended two golden coins in my direction. “Consider yourself hired.”\n“Why me?”\n“You’re an honest man, Ben. I know you’re trying to send the twins to the university.”\nI stared at the two coins in disbelief. It was easily more than I made in a year, not an offer I could turn away under any circumstance. “Thanks, foreman.” I turned to the new arrival. “Got an axe? We got a few spares piled by the office.”\nThe man nodded, pulling one from his oversized pack. It was evident that the item was well made, likely by the hands of one of the seven master smiths. “Lead the way,” he instructed in a cold, somewhat familiar voice.\nI didn’t think anything of the axe or the man’s dark tone until much later. Instead, I smiled and led the stranger to the tree I’d been working on earlier, blinded by the two golden coins secured within my shirt pocket.\n“As you can see, I’ve already given you a head start on this one,” I explained, retrieving my axe. “Just keep hacking away. I’ll let you know when the time comes to properly fell it.”\nJoel examined the tree for a long moment before turning back to me. “You’re not an easy man to find, *Ben*.”\nI froze. “What do you mean?”\n“You didn’t leave behind a single clue at your fortress and there were only scant rumors of your travels throughout the great cities. I’ve been searching for you ever since I woke up, defeating every other hostile character in the Realm. Now, I can finally–”\nI didn’t allow the hero to finish. Without a word, I dropped my axe and sprinted into the forest, a wave of fire racing after me."}

The once timid looking juvenile suddenly became the most frightening man in the room, even more so than my own boss.\n'Now, I appreciate if you don't spread around my identity, so let's make a deal. Tell me who and where your boss is, what's his connection to this Divinity character, and how many of this enhancement drug do you have in store,' he said cooly.\n'I-I'm just an employee, man. I just ship things around, and guard the goods here. I don't know anything about the boss whereabouts, or who he is,' I shivered. 'If anything, Greg over there might know something. He's the manager!'\nThe hero turned to him, who was still out cold. 'Huh, I thought you're the manager here,' the hero admitted. 'Nevertheless, tell me what you DO know.'\nWithout a choice, I told him everything that I do know. The amount of drugs we shipped and where they're shipped to, the amount of cash I earned for doing my job, and finally the kinds of people I worked for.\nThe hero listened attentively, noting everything down on his small leather notebook.\nNow that I took a good look at him, I realized a thing or two. He's... young, someone who recently reached a legal age. Hell, he should still be a student in some hero school if he's aiming to be one, and even then, if he were to do some hero act, he should be accompanied by a professional hero.\nBut... he's different from every hero I saw and faced. He's the embodiment of power, strength.\nHe's the the famous, or infamous, vigilante that protects the world in time where heroes aren't capable to.\nHe's... THE OMNIPOTENT.\n'Alright, that should be all,' he sighed. He dialled up the emergency service, and called the police to our location. I thought to myself, 'This is it, huh. All these years of running away and bodyguarding, ends with a kid busting my ass.'\nTo my surprise, he undo the rope on my hands. 'Alright, you're free to go,' he said.\n'I'm... sorry?' I perplexed.\n'When I knocked you out, I've read everything about you. Unlike these people here, you're a desperate man looking a way to live, and got yourself tangled to this organization against your will. You're doing whatever you could to keep your family afloat.'\nI was speechless. I didn't think this kid would be sympathetic to a thug like me, much less care about my circumstances. Most heroes would just cuff me and send me to prison.\n'It won't undo the crimes I did before,' I told him. 'I did a fuck ton of terrible things. Cheating, lying, and ruining the lives of the people I wronged.'\n'But you didn't kill anyone, did you?' he said. 'You could've killed me when I broke in, but instead, you chose to knock me out, because you don't have the heart to end me.'\nFuck, he's reading me like a book at this point.\nHe patted me on the shoulder, and sighed. 'I fought a good share of villains and thugs, and I've seen more horrendous acts than you could imagine. I can confidently say that you're not a bad man, just a desperate one.'\nMy eyes were threatening to shed a tear. I tried to hold it back, but it's hard to keep it in when my burdens were finally recognized by someone.\nSirens blared from a distance, red and blue lights flashed through the windows of the warehouse.\n'It's your choice, whether you want to surrender yourself, or...' He gave me a maroon card, containing a phone number written in bright gold color. 'You could do more for your family. I believe you know what to do.'\nA vigilante, no, a real hero, gave me a second chance. A chance I longed for.\nBefore I could thank him, he was gone. Vanished into nothingness.\nNow, the cops were outside, surrounding the warehouse, prepared for a non-existing resistance. A few of my colleagues groaned, slowly waking up from their slumber. Greg cussed around when he found himself tied down, and demanded me for answers.\n'The fuck happened here?!?'\nWith a fresh new start resting on my hand, I told him, 'A hero was here.'"}

He hadn't been kind to himself, even. He had the stories, still. A young girl came and sat up next to him. She greeted him. Dumbfounded, he began talking to the girl. She was wearing a very revealing dress. He asked her if she heard the story of his song. She just looked and smiled at him. He took that as an invitation to talk about his old life.\n*Once I was a virile young man. A strapping man with lots of muscles. I didn't work a day. I simply grabbed my lute and traveled all across this country. After dark days where music and drinking was outlawed, there was finally a holy emperor that had taken this land and blessed it with prosperity. I had to sing. It was my duty. With wars the provinces had been gathered, and unified under God.*\nThe young girl asked what the man had to show for it, besides an early grave. The man thought about it. Not much. Just a simple tune.\nHer eyes lit up. He saw the white fire of eternity in her eyes, as she spoke the echoes of her voice seemed to reverb from the large halls of the gods. *I must confess. I am older than you. And, your tune is all but simple. Can you tell me more about this tune.*\nThe old mans hands shook as he moved his hands towards his drink. It's like the teasing of a woman. Women have difficulties containing themselves when they hear the melody. *It's the deepest bow. To lure people into thinking how sweet and innocent they are. Just like a young maiden bowing to her pray. A legendary act. Like that the fairies of the forest did to the young men they lured into captivity. Trapped in the forest as a growing tree, unable to do anything. But, becoming the parts of the land eventually.*\nThe young, godly maiden before him had her eyes glowing looking at the mortal man. *If I wasn't married to eternity, I would take you as a groom. I've walked for thousands of years. I've seen the wonders of this world built, and I will follow mankind into the stars when they join the rest of us Gods. But, nothing has made me so happy as the song you played. It will be played for thousands of years to come.*\nThe old man sighed. *I miss the old days.*\nThe maiden of Death smiled at that old man. *That young bard there is going to play with his viola your tune. Listen. One movement comes, another continues. The small beginning, the great continuation. The repetition. And, into madness it goes. A king will dance his wit away to your tune. The greatest of all composers will go deaf listening to your song, or they will fall to women and make a mess of their lives. You will make my business flourish.*\nThe old man sunk down on the bar, his body being thrown out with the trash when the tavern closed. It had been a night where the dance had exploded like never before.\nThe old man looked at her with determination. He knew what was coming now. This was the end. *Are you a maiden of death?*\nThe young girl smiled at him. *Life is only the beginning. In the world of echoes, you will walk the path of the shadows with me. I am the maiden of death. Come join me.*\nHundreds of years afterwards, the names of the places had been changed a lot. The thing that stayed the same was the joy of the people dancing to an all too familiar tune. The maiden of Death was walking another dance-floor. The hottest dance-floor in Barcelona. The DJ fired up some chords on his new synth. The algorithm for the sound had been custom made by the finest programmers for this very evening. Millions was wasted on expensive drinks, clothing and other stuff. The crowd erupted and kept erupting in epic moment after epic moment. The show was being broadcasted to the entire globe. The beat was mind-blowing. There was a ghost of an old man barely remembering how alcohol even tasted. He knew he had liked it half a thousand years ago.\nThe maiden of Death followed the young girl into the bathroom. That young girl was going on a much shorter trip. She had danced the night away, and would be remember by some of the men who would become old men remembering their young days and some of the girls she partied with would remember their gangs right until their very deaths.\nThe young girl who had been so very much alive awakened looked into the face of a very, very old man. *Did you like my tune, he asked?*\n*The girl smiled. I wish I was able to live longer, but this blossom burned up in a night filled with stupidity.*\nThe old man touched her face. *Young one. Let's listen to the music some more. I have been listening for a very long while. And, I pick up the poor souls that succumbed to this music I made.*\nThe foolish girl looked at him. *You made this music? Were you celebrated and great?*\nThe old man smiled. *I was but a simple bard. But, every man or woman who wants to call themselves a musician knows my tune. It's called 'the Madness from Spain'. Every who composes, writes my tune. Everybody that plays, plays my tune. People have gone mad over it. Just listen to the dancefloor. It's alive. Some people are probably doing something stupid right now because of that madness. It erupts again and again, until you can't contain it. It's the best. Most people just mention the short Spanish word for it. Follia, means madness.*"}

It was springtime, so the weather was usually warm and comfortable. It hadn’t rained yet, which Herbert counted as lucky. He shot a rabbit on the first day and had to finish the job with his knife when his arrow didn’t.\nThe little animal made an awful noise. Herbert felt really guilty that his poor marksmanship caused unnecessary suffering. He almost turned back with the rabbit, until he realized it wouldn’t be enough. This meal had to feed Father, Mother, himself, Abigail, Jimmy, Otis and little Frank. He needed a deer.\nOn the fifth total day of hunting, Herbert saw a deer. He was beautiful. A 9-pointed buck. A strong, regal animal with more than enough meat. Herbert pulled an arrow from his quiver, nocked it, drew back the string, trying not to shake, aimed carefully and let it fly. The buck made a loud, pained bleat as the arrow sunk into his paunch. He fell over, still making noises.\nHerbert was imagining his father meeting him at the door with a smile, his eyes proud and hopeful. He imagined the feast they would have. Lastly, he thought of sleeping in his own bed for a long time. The warmth of the cooking fire wrapping his mind in security and comfort. As Herbert jogged towards his prey, contemplating this fantasy, he felt a sudden jolt of fear and sadness. The buck suddenly scrambled to its feet and dashed into the Crooked Forest.\nHerbert didn’t even consider the warnings about the Crooked Forest, whispered to him by his cousin Louisa some 10 years ago. Louisa always had a spooky story to tell, and she reveled in the gruesome details. Herbert tried to shoot the deer again while running, but missed badly. He collected the arrow and began tracking the buck. Blood spots specked the green leaves as Herbert tracked. He mostly looked down.\nWhen he first looked up, he noticed the trees had a peculiar lean. It wasn’t as if something bent them, it was more like they grew in a bent way with no apparent cause. Birds made their calls and the odd squirrel scurried up a tree. This place was definitely crooked, but so what? This buck would be worth it.\nHerbert continued to track his prey, finding fresh droppings and more blood. After a few hours, he couldn’t help but notice the forest was bending at a more severe angle than before. This didn’t really make sense, these trees grew somehow severely bent over, it didn’t seem like they could grow like that. Also, the leaves were turning brown the deeper he walked.\nHerbert was startled by a bird. It flew past his ear, making an ugly screeching sound like the rabbit from a few days previous. The bird landed on a jagged, dead branch and stared at Herbert. He wanted to go back, but he needed this deer. He continued to follow the blood spots, wondering how much blood an animal could lose and keep moving.\nEventually, after hours of walking, Herbert began to lose hope. He saw a squirrel crawling on it’s belly like a snake, winding up a dead tree. He noticed that it was getting warmer.\nIt hadn’t gotten dark, even though Herbert walked for days, he followed blood spots for days, he thought of his warm house for days. He noticed that although it hadn’t gotten dark, the light source had moved. The sun was gone, replaced by a light from below. Herbert could not remember when this happened. This new light cast frightening shadows of crooked branches. It lit the birds as they screeched. This new light gleamed on the scaly backs of what once were squirrels.\nHerbert tried turning back, but when he turned around, he was met with the same light. This is what he had to do, he knew that whatever was going on, the answers were in the light. Herbert noticed, after weeks of trudging through this warm, bleak nightmare, that the light was getting brighter.\nA voice spoke to him. “Herbert, jump.” He began to run towards it, dropping his bow and arrows. He suddenly felt elated, his hard work would be recognized, if not by his family, then by his forest. The trees were laying totally flat around the bright hole, all of them dead. Hundreds of animals lay dead, surrounding the light.\nHerbert ran towards it, towards rest, towards home. He fell into the bright hole, his feet kicking air as he tumbled down. The warmth was amazing. He felt loved and wanted. Then, he slammed into a smooth, wet surface. It was a tongue. He tried to scramble away, but the jaws shut around him and Herbert’s final sensation was the feeling of his skull cracking under dull, cruel teeth."}
{"prompt_id":"p210907000","prompt_score":8,"prompt":"At the bottom lives the universe.","story_id":"s210907009","story_score":3,"story":"My fellow seekers of truth, I believe I have found an answer. Maybe not THE answer, but at least it is an aspect of it. I am only one man and I only obtained a tiny speck of knowledge over my years of study. Nevertheless, after all these years I may be able to contribute to the pile of knowledge we have accumulated. Where do our sciences lead? If we follow physics to the fundamental nothingness of matter, what do we see? If we run alongside biology to rejoice in the wonders of life, what have we learned about the nature of life? And if we use mathematics to tear even the fabric of reality apart, what are we left with? Just as I have found one part of the answer, so will these sciences one day find the end of their roads. But today is not that day. Today, we indulge in the oldest science of man, because my team and I have used the last 400 years of our lives to follow its path. What did we find? To make it short, the universe. As we mapped the philosophy of man, we soon found that all questions seemed to lead to a origin of sorts. What do I mean by that? Well, as we took apart the nature of questioning itself we found, that the answer to one question would soon lead to another question. This is common knowledge, but we dared to go further. What if we followed this trail of answered questions to the origin? The methodology had to be designed from the ground up with all sciences in mind. Why does life question it's surroundings? Is awareness and reflection an integral part of the nothing or does it oppose it? And which dimensions would the path along the questions have to cross? For the people eager to review our methods, we have documented the entire process, but indulge me a little further as I reminisce about the path we took. Sadly, the last hundred years were spent discussing questions which language could not even begin to convey. So, we turned to linguists and mathematicians alike to create a language of pure meaning. We partly succeeded and the details have been public for half a century now, so I believe most have aquainted themselves with the concept at least. As we forged ahead, we soon reached the limits of our own psyche, having to design new areas of psychology to accommodate the need of formulating questions as a crowd, not as an individual. At some point though, we reached a point of supercriticality at which we seemed to not ask questions willingly anymore, but the crowd which had grown to several thousand people seemed to ask instinctively. Like a baby opening it's eyes for the first time, we soon developed the same capacity for learning as an infant. We finally spoke the language of reality and it seemed to finally answer us. And when it did, we repeated after it, as a newborn would when saying it's first words. We will soon join as a single mind again, but I have come here in an attempt to do the impossible. I want to convey as much of the answer to the general public, but the longer I ramble the more I understand the futility of it. As a cell would not understand parenthood, so will you not understand the answer. That is why we have documented the journey, you may follow us if you want or you may join us if you can, but do not believe yourselves wise for knowing the one-dimensional portrayal of the answer.

While he'd been disappointed, the dull ache that had led him to get them checked had made his suspicious, so the surprise of it was short lived.

All the people in the town were gathered at the city gates, all eyes focused up at the hill.\nThey could see a flick of the leathery red tail or the hooked tip of the dragon's wing occasionally peek out from the top of the fortress barriers - hovering, waiting with his prize for the knight who comes to liberate it. This prize was the crown princess, Dinavia, known throughout the lands for her kindness and generosity as well as for her ferocity with a sword. This made it strange, to some, that kidnappings like these were rather common for the warrior princess. The Crimson Terror seemed to swoop down from his nest and snatch the princess right from her balcony at least once a week - at the very least, some thought, she should secure that balcony. Avoid it altogether perhaps. Regardless, every week or so the incident happened and ended peacefully; so while it was still a bit of a spectacle, no one seemed to be worried as they looked on.\nNow, eyes were on the knight as she saddled her steed. The sun glared off her steel armor, momentarily blinding those unfortunate enough to be caught in its beam. As she finished securing her saddle she mounted and, with a quick salute and a kick to her steed, raced off up the hill. She could hear the horse pant as the hill reached a steeper incline, feel her hair, tied up in a braid, tighten on her scalp as she tensed her whole body. The horse made a leap over a fallen oak and the knight relaxed her body a bit, remaining focused.\nAs she approached the fortress, she dismounted and glanced down the hill. She could see the little specks of people, still gathered at the city's edge. They couldn't see her face, but they could see the shine of her metal, the frame of her armor. She pulled her sword from its sheathe with a swift, dramatic show, raising it in the air towards the fortress gates.\nThen, with a cry that echoed down to the valley below, she ran. Some villagers couldn't help but hold their breath, despite knowing what was coming, that their silver knight always came back. The knight charged through the wooden gates, coming face to face with the massive red dragon behind them. His nose was leaking smoke and beside him, on a simple stone chair, sat Princess Dinavia - upside-down, her legs dangling over the back of the chair and her head off the seat, and she grinned when she saw the silvery knight. The knight's battle cry turned to a hearty laugh, and she fell down on her butt. As she removed her helmet and began loosening her braids, the dragon shot a sudden flame into the air, then shook its head.\n'Sup, Kit. Think that was enough fire?' The dragon asked in a booming voice.\n'Ow, this armor.. hey Red! Perfect flame, throw out another one in 20 minutes or so.'\n'You're late,' Princess Dinavia shifted to a normal sitting position, 'and you have all the stuff so I couldn't even set up, *Game Master.* '\n'Sorry, sorry,' Kit said, pulling several pieces of parchment from her satchel and passing them out, 'So remind me, where'd we leave off last week?'"}

Instead he came with a job opportunity that I couldn’t turn down.\n“Ali Nader?” He asked me with a frankly jarring gay inflection that did not match at all with his gothic appearance.\nI tried to formulate an answer to his question, but all I could focus on was the station wagon of doom hurtling towards the both of us in slow-motion.\n“Ca...car,” was the one thing I could stutter out as I pointed behind Death.\nHe turned around and then scoffed.\n“Oh yeah, that,” said Death nonchalantly. “You’re going to be fine, handsome.

It actually gets a bit menial. Oh, but you ARE allowed to listen to podcasts or music to break up the boredom.”\n“Wait, what if I don’t want to be the grim reaper?

In the background, the station wagon began to spin uncontrollably.\n“Remember when I said you were going to be ‘fine’?” asked Death rhetorically. “Well it’s more like ‘fine-ish’. You aren’t getting away from this accident completely unscathed. In fact, you’re going to be put in a coma for the next week.\n“Ok, what...what does that mean for me?” I asked nervously.\n“That means if I miss my spa vacation,” began Death. “Don’t be surprised if something goes wrong with life support while your comatose ass dreams of leading the perfect life. Or maybe something goes wrong even right now.”\nIn the background, the station wagon was getting closer, so much so, I could read the look of panic on the driver’s face. I gulped.\n“Plus, it’s the deal of, dare I say, a lifetime?” said Death, returning to a cheekier tone. “Being THE reaper is way cooler than being a vegetable for a week and waiting to be hit with a massive medical bill. Or even just being dead. Hell, you can even put this on your resume.”\n“I ***really*** don’t feel like I’m getting a choice in this,” I said.\n“Yes, my point exactly,” said Death. “So I take it that you agree to this little arrangement?”\nAt this point, the now *whirling* station wagon of doom was unbearably close.\n“OK, OK, OK!,” I yelled. “I accept! I accept!”\n“Fa-bu-lous,” said Death. “I just need you to sign this.”\nI hastily read over the contract and signed a sloppy signature.\n“Wonderful!” exclaimed death, positively giddy.\nThe contract dissipated in a tuft of what I assumed was hellfire. I looked up from this distraction and noticed that Death’s black robe was now replaced with a creamy, floral printed one.\n“Tag bitch, you’re it,” he said before gently booping me on the nose and disappearing from my vision.\nIn that moment, all hell broke lose as time resumed. The station wagon swirled mere inches past me, like some sort of ballerina of death. It made a disheartening crashing noise as it impacted with a shop front behind me. Meanwhile the SUV flipped on it’s back in the road, mere feet away from me, ultimately grinding traffic to a halt. But through all this, I somehow didn’t come to harm.\nFor a good several seconds, I wondered if my deal with the Grim Reaper was even real. Then I heard it. A *woOOosh, woOOosh, woOOosh* sound reverberated just above my head. That FUCKING side-view mirror. ***KONK*.** Then blackness.\nI eventually came to, but I didn’t exactly feel right. I then looked down to notice me standing over my own body. Panic swept over me as I hastily checked what I was wearing. Black. Robes. I turned around to only to be greeted by a scythe perfectly propped up in front of me.\nI sighed, but my sighing was rudely interrupted by a man yelling from the carnage of the station wagon.\n“Holy shit! Am I dead!?” He exclaimed.\n“Holy shit! I AM dead!” He continued.\nHe then began screaming uncontrollably. I reluctantly grabbed the scythe. It was gong to be a loooong week."}
